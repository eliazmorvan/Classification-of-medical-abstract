cardiovascular diseases,"Coronary artery bypass grafting in a patient with cryoglobulinemia. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was performed in a patient with cryoglobulinemia. In order to decrease the concentration of cryoglobulin, the patient underwent double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) pre- and postoperatively as well as during cardiopulmonary bypass. Bypass surgery was performed under total cardiopulmonary bypass, moderate systemic hypothermia, and ventricular fibrillation without aortic crossclamping. No adverse effects of cryoglobulin appeared during the peri- and postoperative course. Technical considerations for open heart surgery in patients with cryoglobulinemia are described. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Conservative management of aortic lacerations due to blunt trauma. Three patients with angiographically documented thoracic aortic lacerations were managed conservatively over 8 years due to the nonthreatening appearance of the injuries in two and the presence of an associated major closed head injury in a third. The lesion(s) resolved in one, diminished in another, and remained unchanged in the third. At least ten other cases managed similarly are recorded in the literature. In certain selected circumstances this approach may represent a viable alternative to the current standard of immediate surgical correction of aortic injuries. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Sudden death from acute cocaine intoxication in Virginia in 1988. A review of medical examiners' autopsy records revealed that in 1988, 33 residents of Virginia died of acute cocaine intoxication. The subjects were 19 to 45 years old; most were men, used cocaine intravenously, and used other toxic substances with the lethal dose of cocaine. "
cardiovascular diseases,Catheterization of coronary artery bypass graft from the descending aorta. The increasing frequency of reoperation for coronary artery disease has led to the use of a variety of grafts. This report describes the catheter technique for selective opacification of a saphenous vein graft from the descending thoracic aorta to the posterior coronary circulation. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Spontaneous rupture of an aortic aneurysm into the left renal vein. A diagnostic challenge. Rupture of an aortic aneurysm into a renal vein presents a rare and difficult diagnostic problem. Often, therapy is delayed because the patient is thought to have a urologic problem. In this instance, CT scan provided useful clues leading to the diagnosis of this entity, and its rapid treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first CT scan done in a patient with aorto-renal vein fistula. "
cardiovascular diseases,"New horizons in the treatment of coronary artery thrombosis. The application of recombinant DNA methodology to clinical medicine offers the clinician a new generation of more potent and specific therapies. Recombinant methods offer great promise in the treatment of coronary artery thrombosis. This review focuses on the characterization of 1) molecules that activate plasminogen locally (in the vicinity of a thrombus) rather than systemically, and 2) molecules that offer new approaches to the inhibition of platelet activation and thrombin activity. We first describe the methods used to uncover these molecules and their characterization at the molecular level. The ways in which this knowledge can lead to the development of agents tailored to clinical needs are then explored. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Delayed rupture of a pseudoaneurysm of the costocervical trunk: treatment with therapeutic embolization. Fourteen days after removal of an internal jugular catheter inserted prior to renal transplantation, a patient presented with brisk arterial hemorrhage from the insertion site. The hemorrhage, caused by a ruptured pseudoaneurysm of the costocervical trunk, was controlled by transcatheter embolization with gelatin particles. One year later the patient reported no problems related to the pseudoaneurysm or its management. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Sudden death caused by coronary artery aneurysms: a late complication of Kawasaki disease. The authors describe three cases (two blacks and one Latin American) of sudden death caused by late complications of Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome). At autopsy each heart contained multiple coronary artery aneurysms with luminal stenosis caused by intimal hyperplasia and thrombi. Although virtually all fatal cases of Kawasaki disease occur within six months of the onset of symptoms, there have been other reported deaths up to 14 years after the acute illness. The coronary artery aneurysms of Kawasaki disease may persist and cause death years after the acute illness. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Dilated cardiomyopathy associated with Chlamydia trachomatis infection. A 26-year-old man was admitted to hospital with acute myocarditis complicated by congestive heart failure, and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Detailed investigations to determine the aetiological factors involved yielded negative results, except for serological evidence of infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. During the follow-up period, dilated cardiomyopathy developed. To the best of our knowledge a similar case has not been reported previously. "
cardiovascular diseases,Right coronary artery injury during tricuspid valve annuloplasty. An unusual complication after tricuspid valve annuloplasty is described where a ring suture ligated right coronary artery and precipitated myocardial infarct and patient death. The need for caution to prevent this complication with such surgery is emphasized. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Occult inferior vena cava thrombosis: diagnosis by sonography--case reports. Ultrasound has become an effective tool for evaluating the inferior vena cava. The authors report 3 cases that illustrate the difficulty in diagnosing partially adherent clots, which may have a high propensity for pulmonary embolism. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Vasculitis as a paraneoplastic syndrome. Report of 11 cases and review of the literature. In a study of 222 patients with vasculitis, we identified 11 who had an associated neoplasia. Seven had hematological neoplasia and 4 had solid malignant tumors. In 4 patients vasculitis gave the first evidence of the neoplasia or of its recurrence. Nine of our patients had cutaneous vasculitis. The other 2 had vasculitis involving the intestine and resulted in acute abdomens. These 2 patients needed prednisone treatment for the vasculitis. Neoplasia should be considered in patients with vasculitis without an apparent cause. "
cardiovascular diseases,Temporal arteritis with normal erythrocyte sedimentation rates presenting as occipital neuralgia. A retrospective review of 46 patients with biopsy-proven giant cell (temporal) arteritis revealed 8 (17%) whose initial presentation was occipital pain. The most likely etiology of occipital pain in these patients was occipital artery inflammation. A Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate less than 40 mm/hour was noted at presentation in 6 of these 8 patients. Giant cell arteritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of elderly patients who present with occipital pain and demonstrate a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate. 
cardiovascular diseases,"The effect of lateral tilt on maternal and fetal hemodynamic variables. We measured maternal blood pressure and heart rate, fetal heart rate, and umbilical artery velocity waveforms in 25 healthy women placed in the supine and in both right and left 5 degrees and 10 degrees lateral tilt positions. Although we found no significant difference among these variables in the various maternal positions, two of 25 women became hypotensive and symptomatic in the supine and 5 degrees tilt positions. Because we could not predict which women would become symptomatic, we recommend lateral tilt of all pregnant women during operative procedures beyond 20 weeks' gestation, including those in the lithotomy position for vaginal delivery. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Hypertension and diabetes in blacks. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge on the interrelationship between non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, obesity, insulin resistance, and hypertension in our attempt to explore the pathophysiology of the high incidence of diabetes and hypertension in the Black population in the United States. A central role for hyperinsulinemia is proposed, and questions are raised that are suitable for investigative clinical trials. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Auto-PEEP during CPR. An ""occult"" cause of electromechanical dissociation? A 64-year-old man with severe COPD developed refractory nonperfusing sinus rhythm after intubation and positive-pressure ventilation. Fifteen minutes after resuscitative efforts were halted, the patient was noted to have spontaneous respirations and blood pressure, suggesting that dynamic hyperinflation was responsible for the observed electromechanical dissociation (EMD). We recommend a brief trial of apnea for patients with COPD and EMD when conventional measures are unsuccessful. "
cardiovascular diseases,"A case report of giant cell arteritis of the uterus and adnexa. Giant cell arteritis of the uterus and adnexa is a rare disorder, which is generally asymptomatic and occasionally associated with temporal arteritis. The true clinical significance of this dramatic microscopic finding remains obscure, but arteritis of the uterus and adnexa may be associated with later development of giant cell arteritis elsewhere in the body. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Hormone replacement therapy. How to select the best preparation and regimen. Hormone replacement therapy is a mainstay of preventive healthcare for the maturing female population. Estrogen deficiency that comes with menopause can have serious effects and is especially important in light of the increasing life expectancy of women. Various estrogen and progesterone preparations are available, and their best application requires understanding of the different potencies and metabolic effects. Daily maintenance therapy without a drug-free interval is becoming the standard method of the 1990s. No doubt the future will bring even better delivery regimens. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Seven-pathogen tricuspid endocarditis in an intravenous drug abuser. Pitfalls in laboratory diagnosis. Polymicrobial endocarditis is being reported with increasing frequency in drug abusers. However, the full extent of infection may be unrecognized with routine blood culture techniques because of the overgrowth of more fastidious organisms by other pathogens. This report documents an intravenous drug abuser with the first reported case of tricuspid valve endocarditis involving seven pathogens, discusses pitfalls of routine blood cultures and examines the role of the laboratory in microbiologic diagnosis. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Multiple breakpoint method for measuring effect of antibiotics on endocarditis strains of streptococci. The activity of penicillin alone and combined with aminoglycoside on endocarditis strains of streptococci was examined. Good assay reproducibility was obtained by the use of logarithmic phase cultures standardised by opacity, careful inoculation of well-plates, removal of antibiotic by membrane transfer and incubating survival counts in hydrogen plus carbon dioxide. The use of 10-fold intervals for penicillin concentration simplified assay design without loss of efficiency. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Myocardial infarction in the young adult. CAD in young male adults below the age of 40 years has generally been found to be associated with the usual risk factors associated with CAD. In a lesser number of young adults, MIs may be related to cocaine use. Sympathomimetic effects and increase in myocardial oxygen demand are factors considered responsible for acute MI in cocaine-abusing patients. In young adults who are asymptomatic following an acute MI and who are able to pass treadmill exercise stress tests at levels of Bruce stage 4 have been shown to have normal coronary arteriograms. Thus this subset should not require routine coronary angiograms following an acute MI. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Pheochromocytoma and acute myocardial infarction. When a pheochromocytoma is manifested as an acute myocardial illness, diagnosis may be difficult to make. If the tumor is suspected early enough, a workup can be done while the complications of the myocardial illness are being controlled (as in our case). The tumor can then be expeditiously removed before any further problems develop. The case presented here underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for a pheochromocytoma in any patient who has an unexpected myocardial event. "
cardiovascular diseases,Pregnancy associated with Gorlin's syndrome. A pregnant woman with Gorlin's syndrome presented for the removal of malignant ovarian tumours. The main problem encountered by the anaesthetists was an unexpected increase in arterial blood pressure. This was most probably associated with surgical manipulation of the ovaries with an increase in prorenin/renin production. 
cardiovascular diseases,Renal vascular disease in African-Americans and other racial minorities. Hypertensive end-stage renal disease is about 10-fold more common nationwide in African-Americans than in Caucasians and 17-fold higher in some sections of the United States. These figures are alarming and require a much greater effort in understanding the causes of this disparity and improving blood pressure control in this population to prevent catastrophic renal damage. More information is also needed about the renovascular status of other minorities. Financial obstacles to antihypertensive care appear to be an important contributing factor to the disparities of end-stage renal disease in African-Americans and perhaps other minorities. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Oral contraceptives in women with diabetes. We evaluated the association of oral contraceptive use with the presence and severity of diabetic retinopathy, hypertension, and glycosylated hemoglobin in women of childbearing age who have diabetes. Neither current or past use nor number of years of use of oral contraceptives was associated with severity of retinopathy, hypertension, or current glycosylated hemoglobin. In conclusion, further study of various birth control methods in young women of childbearing age should be considered. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Transoesophageal pacing for perioperative control of neonatal paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The perioperative management of a 16-day-old infant with recurrent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is discussed. Vagal manoeuvres and medication were not adequate in controlling the SVT. Since the patient was scheduled for extensive surgery in the prone position, it was decided to use transoesophageal pacing as the method of choice for conversion of SVT. Transoesophageal pacing succeeded several times in overriding the SVT and restoring normal heart rate and haemodynamic variables. The advantages and disadvantages of various methods of treating SVT in the newborn are discussed. "
cardiovascular diseases,Oral contraceptives and myocardial infarction. The risk of myocardial infarction in contraceptive users is limited to women over 35 years of age who smoke. The cause of myocardial infarction in oral contraceptive users is thrombotic and not atherosclerotic. Minor lipid changes have no clinical relevance to myocardial infarction in contraceptive pill users and do not appear to increase coronary plaques. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Central retinal artery obstruction in herpes zoster ophthalmicus and cerebral vasculopathy. We present a case of acute central retinal artery obstruction in association with Herpes zoster ophthalmicus and delayed cerebral vasculopathy. Retinal vascular obstruction is rare in zoster, and its occurrence during postherpetic cerebral vasculopathy has not been reported previously to our knowledge. The syndrome of delayed cerebral vasculopathy is discussed as is its possible relationship to central retinal artery obstruction. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Amniotic and thromboembolism. Embolic phenomena in pregnancy demand rapid investigation and treatment. Regardless, some patients will not survive due to the enormity of the insult. Optimally, such patients should be treated in tertiary care centers, but this is not always possible. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Current status of antitachycardia devices. With the limitations of currently available modalities for treating clinically important tachycardias, the role of implanted antitachycardia devices will continue to expand. The challenge of the future will not only involve continued technological advances but the socioeconomic impact of this efficacious but expensive mode of therapy in an era of increasing financial restraints. Further studies to definitively prove the efficacy of more widespread use of antitachycardia device therapy will be needed. "
cardiovascular diseases,"The future of nephrology. The Cellular and Molecular Age of Nephrology has dawned and the future is remarkably exciting. The successful attack on the major causes of renal disease, including genetic diseases, glomerulonephritis, diabetes, vasculitis, acute renal failure, and hypertension, will necessitate improved knowledge about pathogenesis. This new knowledge will allow early detection and target-specific therapies, the array of which is only limited by our imagination. The challenge to be an active player in this exciting future as a physician-scientist in the field of nephrology is indeed a rare opportunity. "
cardiovascular diseases,Coronary artery dilatation requiring high inflation pressure. A patient with rigid coronary lesions refractory to balloon dilatation is described. A Cordis Orion fixed wire balloon able to withstand 20 bar was required for successful dilatation. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Turner's syndrome, fibromuscular dysplasia, and stroke. We report a 43-year-old woman who presented with a right frontoparietotemporal ischemic stroke. She had been diagnosed with Turner's syndrome during childhood and had a history of chronic estrogen therapy. Cerebral angiography showed lesions characteristics of fibromuscular dysplasia involving the right internal carotid and right vertebral arteries. We are not aware of any previous reports describing an association between fibromuscular dysplasia and Turner's syndrome. Although chronic estrogen therapy cannot be ruled out as a cause of this patient's stroke, we suggest a possible etiologic relation between these two entities. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Right-to-left shunting through a patent foramen ovale caused by pulmonary hypertension associated with rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome: a case report. This case report presents a fifty-four-year-old woman with right-to-left shunt in the atrium. It seemed clinically at first that the shunt was due to atrial septal defect. However, she also had pulmonary disease associated with rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome. At autopsy atrial septal defect was not evident, but a patent foramen ovale and pulmonary artery disease were observed. This case suggests that pulmonary hypertension secondary to rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome could lead to right-to-left shunting through a patent foramen ovale. "
cardiovascular diseases,Cardiac arrest due to spontaneous coronary artery dissection in a patient with coronary ectasia--a case report. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a rare event and only in a few patients has the diagnosis been angiographically confirmed during life. A spontaneous dissection of the right coronary artery was detected as a cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in a patient with coronary artery ectasia. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Microangiopathy in the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. The eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with the ingestion of L-tryptophan was recognized in late 1989. We describe our pathologic study of skin, fascial, and muscle biopsies from 21 patients evaluated by light microscopy, histochemistry, and electron microscopy. A perivascular, lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils was present in the dermis, fascia, and skeletal muscle. Lymphocytic infiltration of arteries and arterioles was seen. Ultrastructurally, capillary and arteriolar endothelial cell thickening and necrosis was present. This microangiopathy suggests that ischemia may be a contributing factor to the findings in this syndrome. "
cardiovascular diseases,Coronary ostial reconstruction: technical issues. Coronary ostial reconstruction may be the preferred alternative to reestablish antegrade myocardial revascularization in patients with isolated ostial stenosis. The technical steps of reconstruction are described. The ultrasonic aspirator is a helpful implement in the dissection of the left main and the proximal right coronary arteries. Satisfactory results of coronary ostial reconstruction in the current era seem to fulfill its promise. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Perforin-mediated myocardial damage in acute myocarditis. Endomyocardial specimens were obtained from 7 patients with acute myocarditis. Immunohistochemical examination of the mononuclear infiltrate showed mainly cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Perforin (a pore-forming protein found in cytotoxic lymphocytes) was identified in this myocardial lymphocytic infiltrate and electron microscopy showed myocardial cell damage that may have been associated with these perforin containing lymphocytes. The results indicate that in acute idiopathic and viral myocarditis, myocardial damage may be due to the action of perforin-secreting lymphocytes. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Reperfusion arrhythmias after thrombolysis. Electrophysiologic tempest, or much ado about nothing. Arrhythmias that may accompany myocardial reperfusion have generated significant clinical interest. First, there were concerns, based on animal studies, that high-grade ventricular tachyarrhythmias would pose a serious threat following thrombolytic therapy to treat an evolving myocardial infarction. Second, lower-grade arrhythmias, such as accelerated idioventricular rhythm, were cited as useful, noninvasive markers of successful reperfusion. Critical review of the current data, however, indicates that arrhythmias following thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction are usually neither dangerous clinical events nor consistent markers of reperfusion. "
cardiovascular diseases,Dilated and contracted forms of primary endocardial fibroelastosis: a single fetal disease with two stages of development. Left ventricular endocardial fibroelastosis was diagnosed by echocardiographic scanning in a fetus at 20 weeks' gestation. Repeated prenatal examination over the next 20 weeks' gestation showed the development of the left ventricle from a chamber with a dilated cavity to a small cavity with a very thick wall. These findings were confirmed at necropsy and by the absence of other morphological anomalies. The contracted form of primary fibroelastosis in the fetus must have followed an insult that prevented any further increase in the size of the left ventricular cavity. 
cardiovascular diseases,Infant survival following delayed postmortem cesarean delivery. A 19-year-old multipara was delivered of a living infant by postmortem cesarean 22 minutes after documented maternal cardiac arrest and 47 minutes from the fatal injury. Neonatal follow-up at 18 months of age demonstrated no evidence of neurologic damage. 
cardiovascular diseases,Effect of propranolol on endothelin-induced increase in cytosolic free calcium. This study was designed to investigate the effect of propranolol on endothelin (ET)-1-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+ [( CA2+]i) in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) obtained from rat aorta. Propranolol (0.01 to 1 mmol/L) reduced the changes in the initial transient and the later sustained phase of [Ca2+]i induced by 100 nmol/L ET-1 as well as 10 mmol/L procaine. The inhibitory action of propranolol on the change in [Ca2+]i induced by ET-1 may be involved in one of the mechanisms of propranolol-induced reduction of vasospasms. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Peripheral vascular disorders. Assessment and intervention. Peripheral vascular diseases are being seen with increased frequency in the health care setting today. It is imperative that nurses have a clear understanding of arterial, venous, and lymphatic circulatory mechanisms as well as the pathophysiologic changes that accompany common diseases of these systems. Providing the ongoing assessment to obtain a diagnosis, establish the acute versus chronic nature of findings, monitor progression, plan care, and assess the response to treatment is an important role for the nurse in order to preserve function, life, and limb in these patients. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Proximal posterior cerebral artery occlusion simulating middle cerebral artery occlusion. We describe 12 cases of acute stroke in which clinical features of proximal posterior cerebral artery occlusion simulated the clinical syndrome of middle cerebral artery occlusion. The majority of patients developed contralateral hemiparesis, homonymous hemianopia, hemispatial neglect, and sensory loss or sensory inattention. All 8 patients with dominant hemisphere lesions were aphasic. Accurate diagnosis in each case was achieved only after a head CT, showing occipital lobe, thalamic, and inferomesial temporal lobe infarction. ""Cortical"" signs are probably explained by thalamic involvement. Recognition of this syndrome has implications for management and prognosis. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Penetration of the pericardium by a gastric ulcer--survival after pericardiocentesis. Elderly patients often have unusual manifestations of common illnesses. We describe a geriatric patient having a pneumopericardium from pericardial penetration by a gastric ulcer. Benign gastric ulceration causing perforation of the pericardium or other cardiac structures was recognized as early as 1854; however, until 1964, the condition was invariably fatal. Our patient survived the episode after early pericardiocentesis and medical treatment. Aspects of this uncommon clinical entity and a brief review of the literature are described. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Intravenous enalaprilat therapy for hypertension. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril is available for intravenous administration in the form of enalaprilat. Intravenous enalaprilat is indicated for the management of hypertension when oral therapy is not feasible. However, there are no reports of intravenous enalaprilat therapy exceeding one week in duration. We report the case of a critically ill, 39-year-old woman who received intravenous enalaprilat for the management of hypertension for a period of 21 days. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate were controlled adequately on a regimen of enalaprilat 1.25 mg iv piggyback q6h without any apparent adverse effects. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Occlusion of the brachial artery by thrombus dislodged from a traumatic aneurysm of the anterior humeral circumflex artery. The successful treatment of a brachial artery occlusion caused by a chronic embolizing aneurysm of the anterior humeral circumflex artery is described. In the case of embolizing axillary artery aneurysms, the best therapy is resection of the aneurysm followed by distal thromboembolectomy and vascular reconstruction by a saphenous vein segment. Prosthetic material should be reserved as a second choice. In this particular case successful therapy consisted of ligation of the anterior humeral circumflex artery proximal and distal to the aneurysm, resection of the aneurysm, and transcubital thromboembolectomy. "
cardiovascular diseases,Rash after treatment with anistreplase. A palpable purpura developed on the legs and lower abdomen of a woman of 54 five days after she was treated with anistreplase anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC) for an acute myocardial infarction. Histological examination of a skin biopsy specimen taken 6 days after treatment showed leucocytoclastic vasculitis. The rash resolved within two weeks and there were no other complications. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Coronary artery dissection--a case report. Coronary artery dissection, both spontaneous and catheter-induced, is associated with a significant morbidity and mortality. The authors present a case of a middle-aged woman with spontaneous right coronary artery dissection causing inferior wall myocardial infarction and left coronary artery dissection at the time of coronary arteriography. It is suggested that emergency aortocoronary bypass surgery be performed preceded by insertion of an intra-aortic balloon in acute evolving cases where coronary anatomy is favorable to limit infarction and avert loss of life. "
cardiovascular diseases,Massive hemorrhage from an arterioureteral fistula associated with chronic renal transplant failure. A case of arterioureteral fistula from the graft artery stump of a failed transplant and the native ureter is reported. This case illustrates one of the possible complications of graft anastomosis. The etiological factors involved in the formation of the aneurysm and eventually the fistula are discussed. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Brucella endocarditis: the role of combined medical and surgical treatment. Brucella endocarditis, although a rare complication of brucellosis, is the main cause of death related to this disease. This report describes a case of aortic endocarditis due to Brucella abortus in an elderly farmer with known aortic stenosis. Urgent valve replacement was performed because of progressive heart failure despite appropriate antimicrobial treatment. The infection was cured with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and rifampin given for 3 months after surgery. A review of the literature reports on the 38 other cases of cured brucella endocarditis made clear the need for combined antimicrobial treatment and surgical valve replacement. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Strokes in African-Americans. Hypertension is the most important risk factor for stroke, especially in African-Americans. Improved control of high blood pressure nationwide is a key factor in the recent dramatic decline in stroke frequency, most notably in African-American women. Hypertension control programs must be adequately funded and expanded. African-Americans have a disproportionately high incidence of risk factors for stroke, including hypertension. There is evidence that the cerebral vessels involved in ischemic stroke in African-Americans may differ from those of Caucasians. There is an urgent need for more research on stroke in general, risk factor relations in particular, and mechanisms in the pathogenesis of stroke in African-Americans. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Transient mitral regurgitation due to mitral valve prolapse accompanied by systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. A grade 4/6 systolic murmur, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM), and severe mitral regurgitation (MR) documented by two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography developed suddenly on the structurally normal heart of a patient with idiopathic portal hypertension. The patient did not have signs of congestive heart failure and the aforementioned phenomenon disappeared completely when the patient was in hepatic failure. This could be explained by a change in circulating blood volume either by gastrointestinal hemorrhage or hepatic failure. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Balloon valvuloplasty for fungal endocarditis induced stenosis of a bioprosthetic tricuspid valve. Palliative treatment was provided without complications by double balloon valvuloplasty of a stenotic porcine tricuspid valve in a patient with fungal endocarditis. With two 15 mm diameter valvulotomy balloons the peak tricuspid gradient decreased from 21 to 7 mm Hg and valve area increased from 0.3 to 1.2 cm2. After the procedure the patient clinically improved; however, valve replacement was not performed as planned because the patient developed an intracranial hemorrhage. She subsequently died of complications of fungemia. The present report demonstrates the possible use of valvuloplasty as a palliative procedure in selected patients with valvular stenosis involved with endocarditis. "
cardiovascular diseases,Tension pneumopericardium as a complication of single-lung transplantation. Tension pneumopericardium is distinctly uncommon in the adult population. We present a case of tension pneumopericardium as a complication of lung transplantation in a 54-year-old woman with thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension who underwent single-lung transplantation. 
cardiovascular diseases,Portal venous gas in a patient with Crohn's disease. Portal venous gas usually occurs in the setting of an acute abdomen. Several causes for benign portal venous gas (PVG) have been reported. We describe the finding of PVG by computed tomography in a febrile patient with Crohn's disease and discuss the clinical implications of such a finding. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Technetium-99m sestamibi in chronic coronary artery disease: the European experience. Since the introduction of technetium-99m methoxy-isobutyl isonitrile (Tc-99m sestamibi) in Europe, there has been a growing interest in its use. Several European multicenter trials have been conducted to evaluate this new agent in relation to the traditional perfusion marker thallium-201, and other studies are in progress to understand the use of this perfusion marker for the diagnosis of coronary disease, for use in conjunction with pharmacologic vasodilation, for use in the assessment of ventricular function and wall motion and for the assessment of interventions. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Biplane transesophageal echocardiography: technique, image orientation, and preliminary experience in 131 patients. Transesophageal echocardiography with use of a uniplane phased-array transducer with a transverse or horizontal scanning plane has become a well-established tool for evaluating cardiovascular diseases. Recent introduction of biplane probes has enhanced the diagnostic capability of this imaging technique. This article discusses the technique of biplane transesophageal echocardiographic examination and image orientation. The diagnostic value and advantages of various biplane transesophageal images of the heart, aorta, and aortic arch from various esophageal positions are described. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Giant cell arteritis. A case with unusual neurologic manifestations and a normal sedimentation rate. Giant cell (temporal) arteritis is a serious inflammatory condition that can lead to blindness, stroke, or other adverse sequelae if not properly treated. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate has traditionally been emphasized as a criterion for making this diagnosis. Delays in diagnosis and unnecessary testing may occur when a patient presents with a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate and a clinical history consistent with this condition. We describe a patient with giant cell arteritis who presented with a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate and who subsequently developed devastating central nervous system complications. "
cardiovascular diseases,Chylothorax secondary to obstruction of the superior vena cava: a complication of the LeVeen shunt. A case of thrombosis of the superior vena cava was complicated by bilateral chylothoraces and a widened mediastinum. Removal of a clotted LeVeen shunt led to prompt resolution of the obstruction and chylothoraces. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Babinski-Nageotte syndrome on magnetic resonance imaging. A 70-year-old woman developed left hypoglossal nerve palsy, a right hemiparesis sparing the face, and a typical left Wallenberg's syndrome. These symptoms resulted from a lesion in the left half of the medulla oblongata, suggesting Babinski-Nageotte syndrome, a rare cerebrovascular disease. This is the first case of ischemic infarction in the territory of the left vertebral artery and posterior inferior cerebellar artery demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging. Severe bilateral lesions of the distal vertebral arteries demonstrated on digital subtraction angiography may have contributed to the development of this syndrome. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Full recovery after a chloroquine suicide attempt. The nonfatal case of a 20 year-old woman who ingested 6 grams of chloroquine in a suicide attempt is reported. After initial ventricular fibrillation, she rapidly developed a pulmonary edema with cardiogenic shock. She was successfully treated with diazepam, epinephrine, dobutamine and mechanical ventilation. Plasma chloroquine levels showed an initial peak of 36 micrograms/mL. The patient was discharged fully recovered after 19 days. The interaction between chloroquine and diazepam is discussed, as is the need for careful management of epinephrine therapy. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Downslope claudication in eosinophilic fasciitis: a fourth type of claudication--case presentations. Two patients who presented with discomfort in the calves while walking down a slope were diagnosed as suffering from eosinophilic fasciitis of the lower limbs. Following therapy of the underlying disease, this peculiar discomfort remitted concomitantly with the disappearance of the subcutaneous abnormalities. The authors posit that downslope claudication of the calves in eosinophilic fasciitis constitutes an additional variant of claudication of the lower limbs. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Anaphylactoid reactions during hemodialysis on AN69 membranes in patients receiving ACE inhibitors. We report five life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions occurring within the very first minutes of hemodialysis on polyacrylonitrile (AN69) capillary dialyzers in three patients receiving ACE inhibitors. Such reactions were not observed either in patients treated with ACE inhibitors but dialyzed on other membranes (N = 9), nor in patients on AN69 who did not receive ACE inhibitors (N = 19). These anaphylactoid reactions could be due to bradykinin accumulation, as a result of both increased synthesis--by interaction of blood with the AN69 polymer--and catabolism blockade by ACE inhibitors. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Lovastatin. Warfarin interaction. Two patients who developed hypoprothrombinemia and bleeding due to lovastatin-warfarin drug interaction are described. Because of the wider use of lovastatin and warfarin, heightened clinical awareness of this potentially serious interaction must be publicized. Therefore, prothrombin time should be monitored diligently when warfarin is prescribed to patients receiving lovastatin. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Assessment of ventricular function with an ambulatory left ventricular function monitor. Changes in ventricular function caused by activities of daily living, including standing, walking, stair climbing, and mental stress, were evaluated using a radionuclide device that recorded left ventricular function on a beat-by-beat basis. The ambulatory monitor was positioned over the patient's left ventricle after a gated blood pool scan. Monitoring revealed a 10% increase of left ventricular ejection fraction from baseline to brisk walking, an 18% increase during stair climbing, and a 6% increase with mental stress. In some subjects, however, the increase in ejection fraction during mental stress exceeded that during exercise. "
cardiovascular diseases,Retroperitoneal fibrosis after surgery for aortic aneurysm in a patient with periarteritis nodosa: successful treatment with corticosteroids. A 54-year-old man with hepatitis B virus-related periarteritis nodosa developed retroperitoneal fibrosis with bilateral hydronephrosis 2.5 months after placement of an aortobifemoral prosthesis for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Retroperitoneal fibrosis disappeared after treatment with corticosteroids. This observation is interesting in the light of the hypothesis that retroperitoneal fibrosis is caused by vasculitis. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Central retinal vein obstruction and axial length. The axial lengths of 24 consecutive adult eyes with unilateral central retinal vein obstruction (CRVO) were compared with those of contralateral unaffected eyes and those of a control population. The lengths of the two eyes of persons with a unilateral CRVO were not significantly different. By contrast, eyes of persons with CRVO averaged 0.67 mm (approximately 2 diopters) shorter than their control counterparts (P = .03). This anatomic difference may be a factor in the development of CRVO. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Pulmonary-renal syndrome with ""triad"" involvement due to small vessel vasculitis. We describe the clinical course and morphologic findings of a 22-year-old woman presenting with a systemic disease that included nasal ulceration, hemoptysis and rapidly progressive renal failure. Biopsies of nasal septum and lung revealed small vessel leukocytoclastic angiitis while renal biopsy showed a diffuse crescentic glomerulonephritis. Immunosuppressive therapy resulted in remission of clinical symptoms and resolution of glomerulonephritis as documented in a followup biopsy. Although her clinical presentation with triad organ involvement strongly suggested Wegener's granulomatosis, this case illustrates that other varieties of vasculitis may mimic Wegener's granulomatosis. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Improved results with combined donor-specific transfusion (DST) and sequential therapy protocol. A combined DST-sequential CyA therapy protocol has been described that results in optimum graft survival for 1- and 2-haplotype mismatched living related donor-recipient combinations. In addition to the excellent graft survival obtained through 4 years, lower prednisone and CyA dosage levels are achieved with significantly decreased infection rates during the posttransplant period. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Possible triggering of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in normal hearts by psychological stressors: a report of two cases. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was triggered by psychological stress in two patients, both of whom had normal echocardiograms and coronary angiography. Neither patient was alcoholic or had ingested ethanol in relation to the onset of atrial fibrillation and both were free of metabolic derangements. Possible mechanisms involved in the triggering of atrial fibrillation are discussed. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Fulminant hepatitis after lisinopril administration. A case of fulminant hepatitis in a patient taking lisinopril for 5 weeks for arterial hypertension is reported. Jaundice, fever, myalgia, and marked increase in serum aminotransferase activities occurred after 2 weeks of treatment. Continuation of lisinopril administration for 3 weeks after the onset of jaundice was associated with the development of grade III encephalopathy and a marked decrease in prothrombin and proaccelerin levels. This case strongly suggests that lisinopril may induce acute hepatitis and that continuation of the treatment after the onset of jaundice can lead to life-threatening hepatic failure. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Pheochromocytoma in the pediatric age group: the prostate--an unusual location. Pheochromocytomas of the prostate are rare, with only 3 cases in adults reported in the literature. We present the case of an 8-year-old boy with a pheochromocytoma of the prostate and a second tumor in the region of the left internal iliac artery. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Pulmonary capillaritis and glomerulonephritis in an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive patient with prior granulomatous aortitis. A 59-year-old man showed asynchronous development of noninfectious granulomatous aortitis with aneurysm, followed 9 months later by pulmonary capillaritis and glomerulonephritis in association with elevated serum antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody levels. To our knowledge, the combination of large artery vasculitis and small vessel systemic vasculitis (capillaritis) has not been previously reported. This case may represent a hybrid type of systemic vasculitis combining features of giant cell arteritis and Wegener's granulomatosis. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Oral labetalol in hypertensive urgencies. The response to incremental doses of oral labetalol in 16 patients with hypertensive urgencies is presented. After inadequate blood pressure control with 20 mg of intravenous furosemide, each patient received a 300 mg oral dose of labetalol. Subsequent oral doses of labetalol, 100 mg, were administered at 2-hour intervals, if the diastolic blood pressure remained greater than 100 mm Hg. The maximum dose of labetalol per patient was 500 mg. Five patients required only the initial 300 mg dose of labetalol. Two patients required further therapy for satisfactory blood pressure control. Mean arterial pressure fell from 156 +/- 12 mm Hg to 123 +/- 14 mm Hg. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Myotonic heart disease: a clinical follow-up. We followed 37 patients with myotonic dystrophy for a mean of 6 years. Two developed atrial flutter or fibrillation, 6 developed a new bundle branch block, 1 developed complete heart block requiring a pacemaker, and another with progressive 1st-degree heart block and a widening QRS interval had a sudden death. Most patients had predictable, gradually progressive disease of their cardiac conduction system. We recommend that patients with progressive atrioventricular block or widening QRS interval due to myotonic heart disease have yearly ECGs and be questioned about syncope or presyncope to determine the need for a cardiac pacemaker. "
cardiovascular diseases,"The failure of serial pneumatic cuff venous occlusion plethysmography to predict patients at risk for pulmonary emboli after trauma. Over a three month period, attempts to perform serial Pneumatic Cuff Venous Occlusion Plethysmography (VP) were carried out in 51 severely injured patients felt to be at risk for Pulmonary Embolus (PE). Studies could not be performed in 25 of these patients due to the nature of their injuries. Of the remaining 26 patients, two showed evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Venography confirmed the diagnosis in only one of these patients. Serial VP failed to predict PE in all five patients in whom it was diagnosed. This article concludes that serial VP is not an effective predictor of PE in these patients. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Ventricular tachycardia in two patients with AIDS receiving ganciclovir (DHPG). We report two cases of patients who developed ventricular tachycardia while receiving intravenous infusions of ganciclovir [9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxy)methylguanine, DHPG]. Worsening cytomegalovirus infection prompted renewal of ganciclovir therapy under close cardiac monitoring in one of these patients, and ventricular tachycardia recurred. The close temporal relationship between administration of the drug and onset of the arrhythmias in conjunction with the absence of other factors known to predispose to arrhythmias suggest that ganciclovir may have played a role in the development of arrhythmias in these patients. The clinical courses of the patients are discussed, as are autopsy results. "
cardiovascular diseases,Cerebral venous thrombosis due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. A patient with polycythemia vera who was treated with heparin for superficial septic thrombophlebitis developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and cerebral venous thrombosis with superior sagittal sinus occlusion 11 days after the institution of heparin therapy. We suggest that the severe thrombotic response to the heparin-induced platelet disorder in this patient occurred because the polycythemia vera and the purulent infection enhanced the thrombophilia caused by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. This condition can be avoided in most instances if heparin is used for no longer than 5 days. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Retinal vasculitis--a primer. Retinal vasculitis is a diagnosis that is generally suggested by an ophthalmologist. Frequently patients with the disorder are referred to nonophthalmologists for further diagnostic evaluation or treatment. The criteria for defining vasculitis differ greatly between ophthalmologists and other physicians. To facilitate collaboration between ophthalmologists and their colleagues, we have sought to clarify the term ""retinal vasculitis"" by discussing its subcategories, the potential role of antiphospholipid antibodies, and the etiology of retinal vasculitis. We offer guidelines for evaluating the disorder and treating patients. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Implantation of an endoluminal prosthesis at the distal anastomosis of a bypass graft for abrupt closure following balloon angioplasty. A coronary Wallstent was implanted in a 10-year-old saphenous vein bypass graft following a PTCA that was complicated by abrupt closure. Anterograde flow was restored and no myocardial necrosis resulted. One week later, bypass surgery was performed due to a bleeding complication associated with the anticoagulation regimen. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Vascular entrapment of intra-aortic balloon after short-term balloon counterpulsation. Prolonged, continuous intra-aortic balloon (IAB) counterpulsation for several weeks can result in balloon entrapment secondary to thrombus formation in the balloon lumen. In this report, we describe a patient who developed IAB entrapment, early (1 wk) after initiation of counterpulsation. A trace amount of blood was noted in the tubing connecting the balloon catheter to the console for 3 days prior to IAB malfunction and vascular entrapment. We suggest that the balloon catheter be removed immediately when blood is detected in the external connecting tubing even if the IAB is functioning satisfactorily. "
cardiovascular diseases,False aneurysm of the internal mammary artery. Iatrogenic false aneurysm of a branch of the internal mammary artery after sternal wire closure is a very rare occurrence. We describe a case which appeared in a 62 year old woman operated upon for mitral valve replacement and diagnosed after Digital Subtraction Angiography. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Endocarditis in the emergency department. Clinical presentations and pathogeneses of endocarditis and aspects of its diagnosis and management relevant to emergency department practice are reviewed. Guidelines for admission, laboratory evaluation, and decisions regarding the initiation of therapy in the ED are offered. Also discussed are the role of the emergency physician in the prevention of iatrogenic infection and current recommendations regarding administration of prophylactic antibiotics for ED procedures. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Fatty infiltration: another restrictive cardiomyopathic pattern. Restrictive cardiomyopathies have been shown to occur as result of infiltrative processes from a variety of sources. The current report describes an obese male, who was found to have hemodynamic evidence of a restrictive cardiac process. His pericardium was proven to be normal and an incisional biopsy obtained of the myocardium during coronary artery bypass surgery demonstrated histologic evidence of fatty infiltration of myocardium. Review of the restrictive and pathology literature is discussed and indicates that this is the first report to demonstrate the association between fatty infiltration and hemodynamic findings consistent with a restrictive cardiomyopathy. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Neurologic abnormalities in a patient with human ehrlichiosis. Human ehrlichiosis is a tick-borne rickettsial disease characterized by fever, headache, myalgias, anorexia, and occasionally rash. In our patient, changes in mental status, upper motor neuron signs, cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, and increased serum protein levels were found in association with serologically confirmed ehrlichiosis and were most likely due to vasculitis involving the central nervous system. Intraleukocytic inclusions, although observed in our case, have been infrequently found in other reported cases of ehrlichiosis. "
cardiovascular diseases,"ST segment alternans during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty--a case report. The occurrence of electrical alternans of the ST segment has been reported in patients with variant angina. The authors encountered a patient with typical electrical alternans of the ST segment in leads V4 through V6, which developed during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of the proximal left anterior descending artery. Hemodynamic pulsus alternans of the aortic pressure tracing was not observed during electrical alternans, and a Ca2+ blocker could not prevent this phenomenon during PTCA. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Unusual opening of coronary sinus in atrioventricular septal defects. The coronary sinus is an important landmark for the position of the atrial component of the atrioventricular conduction axis and, thus, assumes special relevance to the surgeon in the operating room. We describe here 2 patients with atrioventricular septal defect characterized by an unusual termination of the coronary sinus within the left atrium. We discuss the potential importance of this finding to the disposition and surgical avoidance of the conduction tissues. "
cardiovascular diseases,Vascular abnormalities in epidermal nevus syndrome. We report a patient with epidermal nevus syndrome and right hemispheric infarct and review 3 others with neurologic manifestations best explained by ischemia or hemorrhage. Each had a significant vascular abnormality such as occlusion or blood vessel dysplasia. None had hemimegalencephaly. We hypothesize that underlying vascular dysplasia is the cause of the neurologic lesions in these patients. 
cardiovascular diseases,Coronary artery fistula formation secondary to permanent pacemaker placement. We present the findings in two patients who apparently developed a coronary artery fistula as a complication of an endocardial pacing electrode. This complication may actually be occurring more frequently than recognized because the patient may be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and therefore not undergo a coronary angiogram. Awareness of this potentially serious complication is important and stresses the need for proper electrode placement without excess pressure on the tip. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Torsade de pointes: a critical care nurse's dilemma. Torsade de pointes is a polymorphous ventricular tachycardia characterized by a gradual change in the direction of the QRS complex. Because critical care nurses are the first to recognize arrhythmias, they require the knowledge and skill to intervene appropriately. This case report focuses on identification of the characteristics, contributing factors, therapeutic modalities, and relevant nursing diagnoses for the patient with torsade de pointes. "
cardiovascular diseases,Combined repair of transposed great arteries and total anomalous pulmonary venous connection. We report an unusual association of transposition of the great arteries and total anomalous pulmonary venous connection in the right atrium that was successfully repaired by a modified Mustard procedure. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Heart disease in Asians and Pacific-Islanders, Hispanics, and Native Americans. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for Asian-Americans and Pacific-Islanders, Hispanic-Americans, and Native Americans. Generally, heart disease death rates are lower in these population groups than in Caucasians, with the notable exception of Native Americans under the age of 35. Of particular interest are data for southwestern US Native Americans and Mexican-Americans, which indicate low CHD prevalence rates despite high rates of obesity, diabetes mellitus, increasing hypertension, and low socioeconomic status. Much more research is needed to explain these and other observations. Intervention in those risk factors already identified is necessary, particularly in prevention of obesity and diabetes. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Clinical safety and efficacy of celiprolol. The management of essential hypertension requires therapeutic selections that are not only effective in reducing diastolic blood pressure but are also tailored to the individual patient, with minimal effect on patient demographics, concurrent illnesses, and cardiovascular risk factors. Celiprolol hydrochloride is a new highly cardioselective vasodilating beta-adrenoceptor antagonist that has been proven effective and safe for the treatment of essential hypertension. It is comparable to other therapies in blood pressure control while demonstrating an excellent safety profile, favorable hemodynamic activity, and minimal effects on other cardiovascular risk factors. Celiprolol may offer the physician a unique therapeutic alternative. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Purulent pericarditis and cardiac tamponade caused by Nocardia asteroides in mixed connective tissue disease. Pericardial nocardiosis is extremely rare, but may affect especially immunocompromised hosts. We describe the first reported case of purulent pericarditis with cardiac tamponade as the initial presentation of systemic nocardiosis in a patient with mixed connective tissue disease. Our case emphasizes the importance of identifying infectious causes of pericarditis in patients with connective tissue diseases. Longterm survival was achieved with a combined medical and surgical approach. "
cardiovascular diseases,Pivotal role of early and sustained infarct vessel patency in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction unequivocally has improved short- and long-term mortality. The fundamental goal of therapy for evolving myocardial infarction is early and sustained infarct vessel recanalization. The mechanisms linking an open artery with improved long-term survival and other clinical outcomes are presented with use of data from extensive clinical trials. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Systolic hypertension in the elderly: reasons not to treat. Isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Accurate measurement of blood pressure in older patients is difficult. Therapy can be associated with various complications, and the special problems of the elderly, such as orthostatic hypotension and hyperkalemia, should be carefully considered. Drugs should be used in low doses and changes in dosage should be made infrequently. Patients should be monitored frequently for untoward effects of therapy. The benefits of blood pressure reduction and the optimal degree of blood pressure reduction remain unknown. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Gastric outlet obstruction caused by traumatic pseudoaneurysm of superior mesenteric artery. Traumatic pseudoaneurysms of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) are extremely rare. We describe two cases of posttraumatic proximal SMA pseudoaneurysms with symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction. Repair was accomplished by aorta-SMA bypass with saphenous vein. Injuries to the proximal SMA are easily missed at laparotomy, especially if intestinal ischemia or hematomas are absent. Recognition and repair are stressed to avoid the complications associated with pseudoaneurysm formation. "
cardiovascular diseases,Spontaneous dural carotid-cavernous fistula with central retinal vein occlusion and iris neovascularization. Spontaneous dural carotid-cavernous fistulas are dural vascular malformations that usually run a benign course. We present a case of a spontaneously occurring dural carotid-cavernous fistula complicated by central retinal vein occlusion and iris neovascularization that led to progressive visual failure. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Arteriovenous malformation of the tongue. Polyvinyl alcohol particles used to embolize an arteriovenous malformation of the tongue were only temporarily successful. Additional embolization therapy was necessary and was complicated by ischemic ulcers of the tongue. We conclude that embolization therapy can be used, but the efficacy of this therapy in the longer term remains to be determined. "
cardiovascular diseases,Warning: fatal reaction to the use of fibrin glue in deep hepatic wounds. Case reports. Two cases of severe hypotension following the use of fibrin glue for hemostasis in hepatic injuries are reported. A systemic reaction to bovine thrombin via large venous lacerations is suspected. A preliminary animal study supports this hypothesis. Caution is advised in the use of fibrin glue for hemostasis in deep hepatic wounds. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Diabetic nephropathy: can the natural history be modified? Those diabetic patients who progress to advanced kidney disease constitute a subpopulation that is particularly vulnerable to the angiotoxic effects of the insulin-dependent disorder. Until the predisposing factors are identified, the most effective way to arrest renal deterioration is by controlling those currently recognized risk factors that accelerate the glomerulopathy. Treatments that normalize blood pressure, reduce dietary protein intake, and control hyperglycemia have been shown to retard the progression of diabetic nephropathy. "
cardiovascular diseases,Right pulmonary artery obstruction after pulmonary artery banding. Serial assessment of pulmonary artery flow by Doppler echocardiography was carried out in 15 infants after pulmonary artery banding. Three infants were identified as having branch pulmonary artery obstruction based on diastolic pulmonary artery flow. It is concluded that this flow profile may be specific for branch pulmonary artery obstruction after pulmonary artery banding. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Palliative repair of aortic atresia associated with tricuspid atresia and transposition of the great arteries. Successful palliative repair of aortic atresia and hypoplastic aortic arch associated with tricuspid atresia in a neonate is described. The repair consisted of reconstruction of the hypoplastic aortic arch with an equine pericardial patch, division of the patient ductus arteriosus, connection of the pulmonary artery to the aorta, implantation of the proximal part of the ascending aorta into the main pulmonary artery, and anastomosis of a polytetrafluoroethylene graft 5 mm in diameter between the right ventricular outflow tract and the central pulmonary artery, which was transferred anteriorly to the main pulmonary artery. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Tongue ischemia from a soft-drink can: report of case. A young girl was brought to the emergency department because her tongue became entrapped while she was drinking from an aluminum soft-drink can. A dental drill was used to remove the can. The tongue was observed for 48 hours, during which an ischemic area recovered spontaneously. "
cardiovascular diseases,"The entrainment of low frequency breathing periodicity. It has been predicted by mathematical models of the respiratory control system that the delay between the lung and the respiratory controller may determine the cycle time found in periodic breathing. We examined cycle time of periodic breathing and circulation time in 11 patients known to have circulation delay due to heart failure. We did not find a significant relationship between the amount of periodic breathing and circulation delay, but found a very high correlation between circulation delay and the cycle time of periodic breathing (r2 = 0.825; p = 0.0001). "
cardiovascular diseases,"Ventricular free-wall rupture after myocardial infarction. Treatment and outcome. Ventricular free-wall rupture remains one of the leading causes of death after myocardial infarction (MI). With increased abilities for diagnosis and resuscitation techniques, surgical correction of free-wall myocardial defects resulting from ischemia and necrosis may become a simple modality of treatment, resulting in improvement of the survival rate. We are reporting our experience with four patients with ventricular free-wall rupture after MI, with emphasis on clinical presentation, diagnosis, and surgical management. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Control of hypertensive emergencies Although uncommon, hypertensive emergencies require prompt recognition and treatment to reduce very high morbidity and mortality rates. Admission to an intensive care unit for treatment and monitoring is essential for optimal care. A Swan-Ganz catheter is often helpful in management. Intravenous nitroprusside sodium (Nipride, Nitropress) is probably the drug of choice for hypertensive emergencies other than those due to eclampsia or pheochromocytoma. "
cardiovascular diseases,Factor XIII deficiency and intracranial hemorrhages in infancy. We report an infant with Factor XIII deficiency who had 2 seemingly spontaneous intracranial hemorrhages. It is important to consider Factor XIII deficiency as a possible cause of unexplained intracranial hemorrhages in infancy. Ongoing factor replacement therapy is recommended to prevent further bleeding episodes. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Mitral valve prolapse. When is it serious? Mitral valve prolapse can best be diagnosed with careful clinical evaluation, including dynamic auscultation. Treatment consists of reassurance, pharmacotherapy for troublesome symptoms, and careful monitoring for signs of complications. Most complications can be either prevented or treated. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Hemolytic transfusion reaction following transfusion of frozen and washed autologous red cells A case of hemolytic transfusion reaction, accompanied by hypotension and followed by transient renal failure, occurred after the transfusion of 1 unit of previously frozen autologous red cells. Subsequent investigation revealed the probable cause of the hemolysis to be inadequate deglycerolization of the unit. The cause of the associated symptoms is unknown. Possibilities include nephrotoxic effects of hemoglobin or stroma, toxic effects of glycerol, or release of vasoactive or thrombogenic substances from lysed red cells. This case of a hemolytic reaction adds to the known risks of autologous transfusion. "
cardiovascular diseases,Native valve endocarditis due to Pseudallescheria boydii in a patient with AIDS: case report and review. A 53-year-old man with AIDS developed mitral valve endocarditis due to infection with the fungus Pseudallescheria boydii. A limited number of cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by this organism have been described. We report a unique case of pseudallescheria infection of a native valve and describe this disease in a patient with AIDS. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Pathological changes in levator palpebrae superioris muscle treated with botulinum toxin in a case of carotico-cavernous fistula. We describe the case of a patient with carotico-cavernous fistula who had botulinum toxin A to induce a protective ptosis 4.5 days before death. The levator palpebrae superioris muscle from both sides and the superior rectus muscle from the injected side were obtained for examination. The preserved samples were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, Martius scarlet blue, Glees, S100, dehydrogenase, ATPase, and toluidine blue as well as being examined by electron microscopy. Inflammation and oedema were found that were probably due to the carotico-cavernous fistula. Axonal and some myelin sheath damage were also seen. "
cardiovascular diseases,Hepatic portal venous gas: an unusual presentation of Crohn's disease. Hepatic portal venous gas is associated with numerous conditions and traditionally has been regarded as an ominous prognostic sign. There are several reports of hepatic portal venous gas occurring in patients with inflammatory bowel disease after or during the performance of colonic diagnostic studies. We report an unusual case of Crohn's disease whose initial presentation included hepatic portal venous gas. The literature of hepatic portal venous gas associated with inflammatory bowel disease is reviewed. 
cardiovascular diseases,Circumflex artery ventricular fistula and pseudoaneurysm after mitral reoperation. Prosthetic mitral valve reoperation complicated by atrioventricular groove pseudoaneurysm and circumflex ventricular fistula is presented. Ligation of the circumflex artery during mitral valve replacement is implicated after review of a previous cardiac angiogram. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Geriatric endocarditis: avoiding the trend toward mismanagement. The average age of patients with endocarditis is increasing. It is becoming a disease of the elderly, especially related to use of prosthetic heart valves and IV lines or catheters associated with bacteremias. Recognition is the major problem in the elderly patient since many features of the disorder are often attributed to aging. The diagnosis should be considered in the elderly patient with fever or other unexplained findings. Blood cultures are indicated to prevent misdiagnosis. "
cardiovascular diseases,Cardiac echinococcosis with fatal intracerebral embolism. A previously well 7 year old boy presented with sudden loss of consciousness and fitting. No evidence of trauma or space occupying lesion was identified. Death occurred the next day due to cerebral infarction caused by embolised fragments from a ruptured left ventricular hydatid cyst that was found at necropsy. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Polytetrafluoroethylene graft for spontaneous coronary dissection: 7-year follow-up. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection remains an exceedingly rare cause of myocardial ischemia. The patients are usually young and female, and the dissection is frequently fatal. The use of polytetrafluoroethylene as an aortocoronary conduit is generally followed by early occlusion. We report a case of spontaneous right coronary dissection in which a polytetrafluoroethylene graft was placed that was observed to remain patent by angiography at least 72 months after operation. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Pheochromocytoma with electrocardiographic change mimicking angina pectoris, and cyclic change in direct arterial pressure--a case report. A forty-two-year-old man was admitted because of chest pain. Electrocardiograms at admission showed horizontal ST depression in leads, II, III, aVF, V4, V5, and V6. Direct blood pressure monitoring revealed cyclic change between 160/100 mmHg and 70/50 mmHg and heart rate between 80/sec and 120/sec at fifteen minute intervals. The plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations were elevated during the episodes of hypertension. Pheochromocytoma was found in the right adrenal gland. These cyclic changes in blood pressure and heart rate are an aid for diagnosis. "
cardiovascular diseases,"An unusual late complication following surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot. A case is presented of extrusion of right ventricular outflow tract patch material through a mediastino-cutaneous fistula occurring five years after repair of tetralogy of Fallot. The focus of the mediastinal infection was an infected epicardial pacemaker electrode placed at the time of initial surgery. Subsequent echocardiographic studies showed minimal right ventricular outflow tract or pulmonary arterial dilatation, and, with no further surgery, the child is well after two and a half years follow-up. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Infectious intracranial aneurysms: comparison of groups with and without endocarditis. A series of 12 patients with infectious intracranial aneurysms is presented, and a number of unusual features of the disorder are emphasized. A comparison of characteristics of the aneurysms and clinical course is made between patients with and without infective endocarditis. Most of the unusual characteristics of infectious aneurysms, including rare locations, causative organisms, and predisposing medical conditions, occurred in the group without endocarditis. The relationship of atypical features of infectious aneurysms to the etiology of aneurysm formation is discussed, and an approach to treatment is presented. "
cardiovascular diseases,A detachable balloon procedure for a traumatic internal carotid-internal jugular fistula: report of a case A case of a traumatic fistula between the internal carotid artery and the internal jugular vein is reported. The fistula was treated by detachable balloon occlusion and clipping of the internal carotid artery. 
cardiovascular diseases,Embolization of a giant renal arterial aneurysm. A 49-year-old man presented with right flank pain. Angiography revealed a giant right renal arterial aneurysm. Giant renal arterial aneurysms are typically treated by nephrectomy. In this patient the aneurysm was embolized successfully with multiple Gianturco-Wallace coils and polyvinyl alcohol. This case indicates that embolization may be a reasonable alternative to nephrectomy. 
cardiovascular diseases,Atrial fibrillation in the elderly: management update. Non-valvular atrial fibrillation is associated with a markedly increased risk of embolic stroke in elderly persons. Evidence is accumulating that anticoagulation with warfarin or aspirin may be effective in reducing this risk. 
cardiovascular diseases,Torsades de pointes therapy with phenytoin. We present the case of a woman with myocardial infarction complicated by malignant ventricular arrhythmia and torsades de pointes. The torsades de pointes was refractory to conventional therapy but responsive to phenytoin. This case suggests the clinical usefulness of phenytoin for adjunct therapy of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias when standard treatment modalities fail. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Parenteral illegal drug use and limb loss. The problem of illegal drug abuse and extremity loss was identified in 27 patients-22 men and 5 women, with a mean age of 26 years. Associated medical problems included: smoking in 27, cardiac disease in 2, diabetes in 3, and hypertension in 3. Six femoral pseudoaneurysms, 2 with distal emboli and all with sepsis and thrombosis, directly contributed to limb loss along with 2 patients with progressive phlegmasia dolens. There were 3 below-the-elbow, 7 above-the-knee, 11 below-the-knee, and 6 transmetatarsal amputations. Eight patients received prostheses; 8 patients subsequently died in follow-up. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Severe tricuspid regurgitation after mitral valve repair: diagnosis by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography. Transesophageal echocardiography facilitates the evaluation of valvular repair in the operating room. The functional valvular morphology and degree of valvular regurgitation can be assessed before and after repair. This technique can also identify unsuspected findings--in this case, severe tricuspid regurgitation complicating cardiopulmonary bypass. We report a previously undescribed cause of traumatic tricuspid regurgitation. "
cardiovascular diseases,Adverse haemodynamic effects of high-dose aprotinin in a paediatric cardiac surgical patient. High-dose aprotinin for reduction of intra- and postoperative blood loss was associated with profound hypotension and flushing in a 3.5-year-old child who underwent cardiac surgery. Treatment with noradrenaline and intravenous fluid was required. Cardiovascular stability was restored after 10 minutes. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Infrarenal abdominal aortic disease: a review of the retroperitoneal approach. Transabdominal exposure is the most widely used surgical approach to the infrarenal aorta. Over the last 30 years a number of surgeons have championed the retroperitoneal approach for repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms and aortoiliac occlusive disease using a variety of incisions. Several studies attest to the clinical superiority of this approach over the transabdominal route and recent evidence demonstrates reduced physiological disturbance with this technique. The retroperitoneal approach is suitable for all elective operations on the abdominal aorta, particularly in patients with high-risk aneurysms and in selected patients with symptomatic and ruptured aneurysms. "
cardiovascular diseases,"The electrocardiogram in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The electrocardiogram is often abnormal in patients who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The most frequent abnormalities are a rightward P-wave axis (greater than or equal to 70 degrees) and a rightward QRS axis (greater than or equal to 90 degrees). In addition, low voltage in the limb leads, an S1S2S3 pattern, poor R-wave progression, a posterior-superior terminal QRS vector or other changes may be present. Transient atrial and ventricular dysrhythmias are common. Knowledge of the usual electrocardiographic manifestations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease enables the clinician to recognize uncharacteristic abnormalities, which often represent the effects of superimposed illnesses or drug toxicity. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Conjugal temporal arteritis. We report the simultaneous occurrence of biopsy-proven temporal arteritis in husband and wife. Serologic and viral studies were negative, including viral culture of the wife's temporal artery. The concurrent incidence of giant cell arteritis in a married couple would suggest a common exogenous exposure. "
cardiovascular diseases,Orthostatic hypotension following right ventricular myocardial infarction corrected with mineralocorticoid therapy. Severe hypotension while standing became a problem in a patient after discharge from the hospital following right ventricular myocardial infarction. Hemodynamic studies showed that right ventricular systolic function did not maintain adequate left ventricular preload and that the patient did not compensate for cardiac dysfunction by increasing blood volume. Volume expansion by mineralocorticoid therapy corrected the orthostatic hypotension and ameliorated symptoms. Hypotension eventually resolved and therapy was stopped four months after the myocardial infarction. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Chest pain in teenagers. When is it significant? Chest pain in teenagers often has no obvious organic cause. Onset of symptoms with an emotionally stressful situation may indicate psychogenic chest pain. The differential diagnosis also includes cardiac, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and respiratory disorders. Routine testing generally does not help to establish a diagnosis and may even do harm by reinforcing a patient's unspoken fear of serious illness. Most teenagers with chest pain have no such illness, and symptoms usually resolve without therapy. An important role for primary care physicians is to provide support during evaluation and follow-up. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Radiographic manifestations of anomalies of the lung. Congenital nonvascular anomalies of the lung can be subdivided into those affecting the bronchial tree and those affecting parenchymal abnormalities. Embryologic development of the lung is briefly reviewed to facilitate an understanding of developmental pulmonary anomalies. Clinical, radiographic, and therapeutic aspects of these anomalies are discussed. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Grinspan's syndrome: a drug-induced phenomenon? Three cases of apparently drug-induced Grinspan's syndrome involving the triad of oral lichen planus, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension are reported. Because drug therapy for diabetes mellitus and hypertension is capable of producing lichenoid reactions of the oral mucosa, the question arises as to whether Grinspan's syndrome is an iatrogenically induced syndrome. "
cardiovascular diseases,Ischemic colitis in a crack abuser. We report a case of acute colitis temporally associated with smoking crack. Colonoscopy revealed a patchy left-sided hemorrhagic inflammation from the rectosigmoid colon to the splenic flexure. Biopsy specimens were consistent with resolving ischemic colitis. This entity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute bloody diarrhea in recreational drug users. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Lobular pattern of choriocapillaris in pre-eclampsia with aldosteronism. We report a case of geographic or mosaic pattern yellowish opaque foci in the left eye of a 36-year-old woman who suffered from severe pre-eclampsia. Though the geographic lesions resulted in chorioretinal atrophy, the mosaic lesion led to no significant atrophy. These two findings were both diagnosed as manifestations of choroidal ischaemia, the former due to choroidal artery occlusion, the latter to transient insufficiency of choroidal circulation, which reflects the lobular pattern of the choriocapillaris. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Sudden death associated with undiagnosed Graves' disease. Hyperthyroidism may result in multiple symptoms attributable to an excess of thyroid hormone. We report a case of Graves' disease in association with sudden death in a previously healthy, undiagnosed young female. This case illustrates an unusual initial presentation of Graves' disease. "
cardiovascular diseases,Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Emery-Dreifuss syndrome is a rare form of muscular dystrophy associated with cardiac complications that lead to sudden death. The disorder and its potential anaesthetic implications in the management of a patient who presented for orthopaedic surgery is described. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Restoration of sinus rhythm during two consecutive pregnancies in a woman with congenital complete heart block. In a woman with congenital complete heart block atrioventricular conduction was normal during two successive pregnancies. Pregnancy, labour, and delivery were uncomplicated on both occasions and complete heart block returned post partum. "
cardiovascular diseases,Malignant thymoma presenting as intracardiac tumor and superior vena caval obstruction. A case of malignant thymoma with intracardiac infiltration and intrinsic superior vena caval obstruction due to the tumor is reported. Intracardiac invasion by a thymoma is rare and for this reason is believed worthy of a report. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Pseudo pre-excitation with concertina effect in idioventricular tachycardia. The concertina effect is a phenomenon where the QRS complexes reflect alternating phases of gradual widening and narrowing. This is most commonly due to ventricular pre-excitation, and the changes in QRS morphology are due to variability of the ventricular zone that undergoes pre-excitation. This presentation reflects a case where the concertina effect is due to an idioventricular tachycardia at a rate nearly identical to the sinus rate. Variable degrees of ventricular fusion therefore occur, and the concertina effect ensues, in relation to slight variations of the sinus cycle. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Compensation and overcompensation in congestive heart failure. The compensatory mechanisms that develop in response to heart failure have been well defined. In this review, it is argued that each compensatory mechanism leads to overcompensation and that there is no way to distinguish between the beneficial aspects of the former and the harmful effects of the latter. Therapeutic agents that maintain rather than decrease blood pressure might perhaps be more beneficial because of the crucial role of hypotension in initiating both compensation and overcompensation. "
cardiovascular diseases,Cystic medionecrosis of the coronary arteries and fatal coronary vasospasm. The histopathological basis of coronary vasospasm is not well defined. We report a patient with directly observed coronary artery spasm in whom cystic medionecrosis of the coronary arteries and great vessels and myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve were evident. We suggest that myxoid connective tissue lesions of the heart may be linked to coronary vasospasm. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Takayasu's disease with axillary, right coronary artery, and right internal mammary stenosis treated with angioplasty. A 47-year-old woman presented with progressive angina and failed medical therapy. After an unsuccessful attempt at angioplasty of a totally occluded right coronary artery, coronary artery bypass using the right internal mammary artery was performed. She presented 2 years later with stenosis in the mammary graft, right coronary artery, and axillary artery. These lesions were all treated with angioplasty. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Retinal vasculitis as a complication of rheumatoid arthritis. Two middle-aged women developed retinal vasculitis in the moderately active phase of classical rheumatoid arthritis. Fluorescein angiography disclosed diffuse leakage from the retinal capillaries and cystoid macular edema, which subsided in response to oral steroid. They did not show any clinical signs of vasculitis in other parts of the body. Retinal vasculitis should be included in the list of complications observed in rheumatoid arthritis. "
cardiovascular diseases,Bilateral infrapatellar tendon rupture in a patient with jumper's knee. This is the fourth case report of bilateral infrapatellar tendon rupture as a result of indirect trauma in a patient without systemic disease. This is the only report we have found of jumper's knee leading to simultaneous infrapatellar tendon ruptures. 
cardiovascular diseases,Popliteal artery occlusion caused by cystic adventitial disease: successful treatment by urokinase followed by nonresectional cystotomy. Preoperative diagnosis of an occluded popliteal artery caused by cystic adventitial disease allowed use of urokinase to successfully dissolve secondary thrombosis. Subsequent non-resectional adventitial cystotomy and evacuation of cyst contents allowed lasting restoration of a patent arterial lumen and return of normal distal pulses. This nongrafting technique may serve as a model for future patients with occluded arteries caused by this condition. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Patient profiling: individualization of hypertension therapy. Although the stepped-care approach remains the cornerstone of antihypertensive therapy, the patient's profile must also be considered. Important issues include the patient's age, race and activity level, potential for hypertensive complications, presence of other diseases, cost of medications and probability of adherence to the recommended drug regimen. Nonpharmacologic treatment based on lifestyle changes is a useful adjunct to drug therapy, but it is not sufficient to control hypertension in most patients. Selection of pharmacologic therapy must be based on a knowledge of each drug's mode of action and side effects, as well as the characteristics of special patient populations. "
cardiovascular diseases,Relation between intraventricular pressure and volume in diastole. The pressure-volume curves for 10 patients with various types of heart disease were studied throughout mid to late diastole when both pressure and volume were increasing. The results were used to test a currently held theory that the form of this relation is exponential. It was found that for the patients examined this hypothesis was not valid. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia: role in hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary heart disease. Resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and hyperinsulinemia may play a central role in the cause and clinical course of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism, and coronary heart disease. This article summarizes the evidence in support of this general hypothesis. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Rate-related left bundle branch block as a cause of non-ischemic chest pain. A case is presented of rate-dependent left bundle branch block associated with chest pain in a patient with angiographically normal coronary arteries. Lactate extraction showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. It appears that in this case, chest pain was associated with sudden ventricular asynergy rather than myocardial ischemia. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Clinical results of axillobifemoral bypass using externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene Seventy-six axillobifemoral grafts with externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses were performed since 1983. The indications for operation were absolute (aortic sepsis) in 20 (26%) patients and relative (excessive operative risk or technical difficulty) in 56 (74%) patients. The life-table primary patency for these operations at 4 years follow-up (mean follow-up, 2 years, 4 months) was 85%. We conclude that the patency results achieved in this patient series are sufficiently satisfactory to warrant use of axillobifemoral grafts in an expanded number of patients with high operative risk and need for bypass of aortoiliac occlusive disease. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Drug-induced supraventricular tachycardia: a case report of fluoxetine. We report the occurrence of supraventricular tachycardia and hypotension in a 54-year-old woman after maintenance therapy with fluoxetine. Although cases of tachycardia and palpitations have been reported, supraventricular tachycardia and hypotension have not been directly attributed to fluoxetine. "
cardiovascular diseases,Successful CPR in a severely hypothermic patient using continuous thoracostomy lavage. Severe hypothermia with cardiopulmonary arrest often requires prolonged resuscitation while rewarming procedures are implemented. A 63-year-old male in cardiopulmonary arrest with a core body temperature of 23.7 C was resuscitated successfully after core rewarming by means of a two-chest-tube continuous thoracostomy lavage procedure. This lavage procedure resulted in effective and rapid rewarming after other conventional rewarming methods had failed. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Spinal cord hemangioblastoma with subarachnoid hemorrhage. A case of subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a cervical hemangioblastoma is presented. The clinical picture was indistinguishable from that of a subarachnoid hemorrhage from an intracranial lesion. The diagnosis was established by angiography and water-soluble contrast myelography followed by cervical computed tomographic scan. At surgery, the tumor was completely removed, and no neurological deficit was observed after the operation. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Propranolol and the morning increase in sudden cardiac death: (the beta-blocker heart attack trial experience). To provide insight into the protective effect of propranolol on mortality after myocardial infarction observed in the beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial, the time of occurrence of sudden cardiac death was examined in this population. Between 5 A.M. and 11 A.M., 25 of the 56 total deaths (38%) occurred in the placebo patients compared with 11 of 45 (24%) in the propranolol patients. Excluding this period, there were nearly equal numbers of sudden cardiac deaths in the propranolol and placebo groups. This retrospective analysis suggests that beta blockade is protective during the morning hours when a surge of sympathetic activity may increase the risk of sudden cardiac death. "
cardiovascular diseases,"The surgical pathologist's role in liver transplantation. Liver transplantation has become an option in treating a wide variety of diseases. The surgical pathologist, as a member of the transplantation team, is increasingly involved in the evaluation of allograft dysfunction. Interpretation of the liver allograft biopsy specimen requires integration of clinical history, biochemical data, and histologic patterns of a wide variety of lesions, including harvesting injury, vascular thrombosis, rejection, infection, and recurrent disease. This article reviews the varied histologic appearances of the more common forms of liver allograft injury, the contexts in which they arise, and their distinction from one another. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome with oral hemangiomas. A case of blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome with oral hemangiomas is reported. Attention is directed to this syndrome because, although rare, it is usually associated with oral lesions. The blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome should always be considered a possibility in patients with oral hemangiomas and bluish skin nodules. "
cardiovascular diseases,Deterioration following delay in performing femoral angioplasty. It is not uncommon for a delay to occur between assessment arteriography and angioplasty attempt. We reviewed retrospectively the arteriograms of 61 patients where such a delay occurred to assess progression of superficial femoral artery (SFA) disease in this interval. A mean delay of 14.6 days (range 2-60 days) occurred between arteriogram and angioplasty attempt. Arteriographic deterioration was found in six of 61 patients (9.8%) and in three this precluded angioplasty. Of the six patients four had initial arteriography via the same side as the SFA disease whilst two had arteriography via the contralateral femoral approach. We discuss the aetiology of this phenomenon and suggestions are made to reduce its incidence. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Aortobronchial fistula after an aortic operation. A 71-year-old man with a postoperative aortobronchial fistula was successfully treated. The fistula occurred between the left lower lobe and the descending thoracic aorta, to which a distal anastomosis of a temporary bypass graft had been placed during thoracic aortic aneurysmectomy 3 years before. For saving patients with this complication, early surgical treatment during episodes of intermittent hemoptysis is important. The use of an omentum pedicle flap for the isolation of the suture line is a important adjunct. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Traumatic rupture of aorta. Diagnosis by Doppler echocardiography. Traumatic rupture of aorta is a serious complication in accidents, mainly road accidents, with a high mortality unless an immediate diagnosis and surgical correction is made. A case of traumatic rupture of the aorta shown in the acute phase by Doppler-echocardiography is reported. This technique can be of great value in the study of patients with thoracic trauma who do not show clear signs of aortic rupture which require urgent aortography. "
cardiovascular diseases,Hypertension after operative correction of club-foot deformity. Severe hypertension occurred as a postoperative complication after correction of a club-foot deformity in four children (seven feet) who were between the ages of two and three years and had no history of hypertension. The hypertension subsided slowly after administration of antihypertensive medications or more rapidly after release of the correction that had been obtained operatively. 
cardiovascular diseases,The surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation. I. Summary of the current concepts of the mechanisms of atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia that is frequently resistant to medical therapy and has no satisfactory surgical therapy. The development of an effective surgical procedure to treat atrial fibrillation has been hampered by the paucity of clinically relevant information on the basic mechanisms responsible for the arrhythmia. This paper summarizes the current concepts of the electrophysiologic abnormalities in atrial flutter and fibrillation. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Fibrosing mediastinitis with coronary artery involvement. This case report describes a patient with chronic fibrosing mediastinitis involving the entire intrapericardial aorta, innominate artery, and the base of the heart with involvement of the proximal segments of the coronary arteries. This finding was unsuspected before emergency coronary artery bypass grafting. Coronary stenosis due to fibrosing mediastinitis is a rare complication of fibrosing mediastinitis. Owing to the extensive fibrosis, the normal bypass, cardiac preservation, and revascularization techniques required alteration and are discussed. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Late rupture of a superior intercostal artery following repair of aortic coarctation. Having had surgical repair of aortic coarctation at the age of 12 years, and re-operation at the age of 19 years for stenosis at the site of the previous repair, a 29 years old man presented as an emergency with a 24 hour history of interscapular pain, haemoptysis and collapse. At thoracotomy he was found to have a ruptured superior intercostal artery which was ligated. Spontaneous rupture of an intercostal artery has not been previously recorded. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Post-cannulation radial artery aneurysm--a rare complication. The following case report describes an expanding aneurysmal dilatation of the radial artery which developed 17 days following cannulation. Possible causes of this complication are: abnormal state of the vessel wall, multiple attempts at cannulation, and haematoma or infection at cannulation site. Other major and minor sequelae following arterial cannulation are reviewed. "
cardiovascular diseases,Percutaneous valvuloplasty in a patient with mitral stenosis following surgical annuloplasty. A case is described in which a patient with a Carpentier-Edwards annuloplasty ring developed mitral stenosis and was treated with percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty. Possible mechanisms for the development of mitral stenosis are briefly discussed. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Arterial switch procedure in an adult. The arterial switch procedure has been shown to offer both anatomic and physiologic correction in infants and children with transposition of the great arteries and ventricular septal defect. We believe that adults may also benefit in some circumstances, as evidenced by the case of a 22-year-old man who underwent successful operation after having initially undergone pulmonary artery banding for transposition with ventricular septal defect in 1967 when he was 5 months of age. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Total knee arthroplasty in diabetes mellitus. A retrospective study was done of 59 total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) in 40 patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. The overall infection rate was 7%, with an overall revision rate of 10% and an average follow-up period of 4.3 years. Wound complications were present in 12% of the TKAs. The rate of deep joint infections in diabetic patients was statistically higher than the reported incidence of sepsis in nondiabetic patients. Therefore, maximum precautions should be taken for diabetic patients having TKA to minimize both wound complications and joint sepsis. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Phosphorus-32-colloidal chromic phosphate: treatment of choice for malignant pericardial effusion. A 68-yr-old male with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia was given phosphorus-32-colloidal chromic phosphate intrapericardially for the treatment of malignant pericardial effusion. Technetium-99m-sulfur colloid was used to verify catheter placement and to visualize distribution within the pericardium. Estimated dosimetry for this mode of therapy is presented, and it is suggested that pericardial administration of phosphorus-32-colloidal chromic phosphate is the treatment of choice for malignant pericardial effusion. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Congestive heart failure: a current overview. Congestive heart failure (CHF), a disease seen primarily in the older patient, can be due to either systolic or diastolic dysfunction. Management is quite different if the heart failure is due to a filling abnormality as compared to poor ventricular systole. The disorder also poses many diagnostic pitfalls in the elderly. Current understanding of CHF and its influence on diagnosis and management is the focus of this review. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta presenting as transient paraplegia. A patient involved in a high-speed motor vehicle accident presented paraplegic to the emergency department. He was noted to have an abnormal chest x-ray and, subsequently, underwent aortography which revealed aortic transection. The patient's paraplegia resolved spontaneously prior to definitive aortic repair hours later. Aortic rupture presenting as paraplegia is a rare association, but one an emergency physician should be cognizant of, especially in the case of blunt or decelerating trauma. "
cardiovascular diseases,Arteriovenous fistula as a complication of temporary pacemaker insertion: treatment with percutaneous embolization. Arteriovenous fistula is a rare complication of central venous catheterization. We present a case of right internal mammary artery-to-right innominate vein fistula resulting from emergent insertion of a temporary pacemaker. Percutaneous management is discussed and the literature is reviewed. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Proximal aortic dissection with cardiac tamponade. Long-term survival without surgery. Proximal aortic dissection in a 79-year-old woman was complicated by cardiac tamponade, aortic regurgitation, and pleural leak. Following pericardiocentesis and control of her hypertension, she survived without an operation for more than four years. "
cardiovascular diseases,"The evaluation of the abdominal aorta: a ""how-to"" for cardiac sonographers. A thorough evaluation of the abdominal aorta can be readily achieved by use of the standard views of the echocardiographic examination. The ultrasound evaluation of the abdominal aorta represents a logical extension of the standard echocardiographic examination of the adult patient. This article provides the information needed to carry out a complete ultrasound examination of the abdominal aorta including the anatomy, the vascular disease, and the steps involved in accomplishing the ultrasound examination of the abdominal aorta. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Pulmonary artery balloon counterpulsation for intraoperative right ventricular failure. Two cases of severe low cardiac output and right ventricular failure after coronary artery bypass grafting necessitated pulmonary artery balloon counterpulsation after intraaortic balloon pumping and maximal inotropic/pressor support were unsuccessful in maintaining a satisfactory cardiac output. Hemodynamic improvement was sufficient to allow removal of the device 2 and 3 days postoperatively, with survival in 1 patient. Pulmonary artery counterpulsation is less morbid in comparison with other mechanical methods of right ventricular support and is applicable in right ventricular failure of intermediate severity. "
cardiovascular diseases,"The iris in Williams syndrome. Forty three children with Williams syndrome and 124 control subjects had their eyes photographed. The photographs were examined by three ophthalmologists and four geneticists of varying experience. A stellate pattern was noted more often in the irides of patients with Williams syndrome (51%) than in those of the control subjects (12%), and was more difficult to detect, or was absent, in heavily pigmented irides. We conclude that the stellate pattern is of diagnostic importance, particularly if the pattern is carefully defined and the clinician is experienced. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Repair of flail anterior leaflets of tricuspid and mitral valves by cusp remodeling. We present an alternative approach to extensive rupture of the chordae tendineae leading to flail anterior leaflets. Resection of the affected cusp segment, suture of the cut edges, and extensive plication of the segment of annulus devoid of leaflets abolished massive regurgitation while maintaining an adequate valve orifice. "
cardiovascular diseases,Catastrophic thrombosis of porcine aortic bioprostheses. Hemodynamically critical thrombotic stenosis of porcine bioprosthetic valves in the aortic position without thrombotic predisposition is rare. Two patients at our institution abruptly manifested thrombotic stenosis of porcine bioprosthetic valves in the aortic position within 3 months of implantation without apparent predisposing factors. Clinicians should consider this rare but catastrophic complication in the appropriate setting. 
cardiovascular diseases,Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm complicating mitral valve replacement in a 4-year-old child with acute bacterial endocarditis. A 4-year-old child with acute bacterial endocarditis required mitral valve replacement. A left ventricular pseudoaneurysm developed following surgery. The etiology and diagnosis of this complication are discussed. 
cardiovascular diseases,A forme fruste of Marfan's syndrome: case history. A thirty nine year old woman presented with multiple aneurysms and dissections of the arterial system secondary to cystic medial necrosis is presented. After assessment of the family history a diagnosis of a forme fruste of Marfan's syndrome was made. Preoperative consideration of this rare diagnosis is important for treatment and surgical management. 
cardiovascular diseases,Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy with cerebral involvement. In a patient with angiographically proven cerebral vasculitis five months after acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE) neurological symptoms promptly responded to steroid treatment. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multifocal white matter lesions in the hemispheres and the brain stem suggesting a diffuse subcortical vasculitis. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Treatment of obstructive pneumatosis coli with endoscopic sclerotherapy: report of a case. The case of an 86-year-old man with cardiac and pulmonary failure, in whom pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis caused segmental obstruction of the sigmoid colon is described. The patient was treated with endoscopic puncture and sclerotherapy of the cyst walls in four sessions, giving endoscopic and radiologic regress of the lesions and symptomatic relief. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Minimizing the danger. Patients with potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias are at an increased risk of sudden death. Antiarrhythmic drugs, with the exception of beta blockers and possibly amiodarone, have not been particularly effective in reducing mortality. Beta blockers have been used successfully to treat survivors of myocardial infarction, including patients with significant impairment of ventricular function. Evidence to date suggests that use of low-dose amiodarone may be appropriate for selected patients with chronic heart failure and potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. "
cardiovascular diseases,Penetrating trauma involving the innominate artery. Penetrating trauma involving the innominate artery is uncommon. Few surgeons have experience with this injury. A successfully managed case of penetrating innominate artery trauma is summarized and the literature reviewed. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Hemorrhoids. A practical approach to an aggravating problem. Although hemorrhoids are considered a minor medical problem, they may cause considerable discomfort and anxiety. Fortunately, treatment is often simple and surgery is rarely necessary. In this practical article, Dr Cocchiara describes internal and external hemorrhoids, a classification system, and treatment choices based on the degree of involvement. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Silicone pouch for protection of automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads. Automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator has become routine treatment for recurrent, drug-resistant ventricular tachycardia. Although there is documentation regarding clinical experience and device performance, there is little information on how to avoid complications related to the retrieval of sensing and defibrillation leads from the subcutaneous space. We are reporting our experience with a silicone pouch for protection of automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads that allows immediate and simple retrieval of the leads in case an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator generator is needed. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura related to ticlopidine 4 patients had typical features of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) after 3 to 8 weeks of ticlopidine therapy. In 2 ticlopidine was the only medication taken before TTP; in another, rechallenge with drugs other than ticlopidine that the patient had been taking did not produce relapse. In all patients the delay between start of ticlopidine and TTP was in the same range as the latent period before ticlopidine-induced neutropenia. No relapse occurred in the 4 to 43 months of follow-up in the 3 surviving patients. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Tricuspid valve papillary fibroelastoma: echocardiographic characterization. We report a tricuspid valve papillary fibroelastoma initially detected by transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography and subsequently characterized by transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography. The mass was excised during open heart operation, and the diagnosis was verified grossly and histopathologically. Transesophageal echocardiography usually provides images far superior to those from transthoracic echocardiography and may be a useful adjunct for intraoperative localization of intracardiac tumors for excision. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Spinal extradural cavernous hemangioma. Three cases of isolated spinal extradural cavernous hemangiomas are reported, two in the thoracic and one in the lumbar region. One of them manifested as acute cord compression, the other two as chronic progressive myelopathy or radiculopathy. A total excision or subtotal excision with irradiation was performed. All of them had good functional recovery. The clinical picture, radiological diagnosis, and optimal method of treatment are discussed. The relevant literature is reviewed. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Occlusion of an ""accessory"" distal anterior cerebral artery during treatment of anterior communicating artery aneurysms. Report of two cases. Two cases are presented in which clip occlusion of a third distal anterior cerebral artery segment occurred during treatment of anterior communicating artery aneurysms. Case histories, angiograms, operative descriptions, and postmortem findings are presented. The incidence of this anomalous vessel is reviewed. Preoperative and intraoperative vigilance in determining the presence of this anomaly prior to clip placement is emphasized. "
cardiovascular diseases,Epidermotropic eccrine porocarcinoma. Three cases of epidermotropic eccrine porocarcinoma are summarized and compared with reported cases. All patients had a long-standing tumor on a lower extremity that rapidly metastasized to the skin and proximal lymph nodes. The histologic picture was consistent with an intraepidermal eccrine sweat gland carcinoma. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Cutaneous vasculitis associated with pheochromocytoma. We describe a patient who presented with constitutional symptoms, severe hypertension, and purpuric lesions over the knees, thighs, and penis. The patient was eventually diagnosed as having multiple endocrine neoplasia type II, with cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The cutaneous vasculitis persisted despite treatment with high-dose systemic corticosteroids, but rapidly resolved after the removal of bilateral pheochromocytomas. This case demonstrates cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis in association with pheochromocytoma. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Emergent signs of cancer. Recognizing them early in the office or ER. Primary care physicians have a crucial role in recognition of potentially emergent conditions in patients with known or suspected cancer. This task presents a significant challenge because the initial manifestations of these conditions are usually nonspecific. In most cases, therapy is far more effective when diagnosis is made at the earliest possible point. Thus, physicians should become familiar with conditions commonly seen in cancer patients, such as superior vena cava syndrome, malignant pericardial effusion, spinal-epidural metastasis, and altered mentation from brain metastases, metabolic encephalopathy, or hypoglycemia. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Steroid anabolic drugs and arterial complications in an athlete--a case history. Serious side effects and complications have been attributed to anabolic and androgenic steroids when used for medical reasons or when taken in sports in hopes of increasing strength and, hence, performance. The author presents a case of an athlete who experienced two metachronous arterial complications after taking these drugs: a cerebrovascular accident caused by a carotid artery thrombus that partially embolized to the brain and, later, a severe ischemic episode in a lower limb caused by a diffused distal arterial thrombosis. This patient represents the first reported case of vascular events in an otherwise healthy athlete taking androgens to increase his skeletal muscle mass. "
cardiovascular diseases,Value of magnetic resonance imaging in spontaneous extradural spinal hematoma due to vascular malformation: case report. A case of spinal cord compression due to spontaneous extradural spinal hematoma is reported. A spinal arteriovenous malformation was suspected on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging. Early surgical exploration allowed a complete neurological recovery. The vascular malformation was histopathologically confirmed. The role of magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of acute spinal cord compression syndromes is stressed. 
cardiovascular diseases,"The incidence of deep vein thrombosis after cementless and cemented knee replacement. The incidence of deep vein thrombosis in 244 patients who had total knee replacement has been studied. In 120 the prosthesis was cemented and in 124 it was cementless. In all cases the replacement was primary and a porous-coated prosthesis with a porous-coated central tibial stem was used. Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed by venography, and pulmonary embolism by perfusion scanning. The incidence of deep vein thrombosis in the cementless knees (23.8%) and in the cemented (25%) was approximately the same. The only significant predisposing factors for deep vein thrombosis in both groups were obesity, prolonged postoperative immobilisation, previous venous disease and hyperlipidaemia. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Prevention of renal disease and conservation of renal function. In summary, we have reviewed some of the most frequently encountered areas of prevention of renal failure in the elderly. They include obstruction, hypertension, drug interaction, and inappropriate use of drugs and the silent killer of the elderly, renal carcinoma. Only by a thorough understanding of the altered physiology of the aging kidney can the physician avoid making the same mistakes when new drugs are developed or new types of diseases are encountered. Proper early diagnosis and understanding the guidelines to therapy in these conditions, can save huge human costs in terms of mortality, morbidity, and money. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Ultrasound-Doppler diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome. We report a case of apparently idiopathic Budd-Chiari syndrome, diagnosed by ultrasound and Doppler sonography, in a patient with latent myeloproliferative disease. This case proves that Doppler sonography shows in the hepatic veins a flow pattern suggestive of partial thrombotic obstruction. Moreover, we suggest that the search for a latent myeloproliferative disorder, by means of the spontaneous erythroid colonies formation in culture of bone marrow or blood mononuclear cells, should be routinely included in the diagnostic evaluation of each case of hepatic vein thrombosis without other recognizable causes. "
cardiovascular diseases,Homocystinuria presenting as central retinal artery occlusion and longstanding thromboembolic disease. A case of central retinal artery occlusion in a patient with a 10-year history of unexplained thromboembolic disease due to a secondary hypercoagulable state is presented. Ophthalmological examination led to the final diagnosis. 
cardiovascular diseases,"The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have additive effects with most other antihypertensive agents, but the mechanisms of these interactions vary. With diuretics the interaction with ACE inhibitors can be explained by their contrasting effects on the renin-angiotensin system, while with calcium antagonists it may be attributed to independent mechanisms of action. With beta-blockers there is a variable additive effect, which has been proposed to be due to more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system than can be obtained with either type of agent alone. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Pericarditis with tamponade due to cytomegalovirus in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A 35-year-old male homosexual with AIDS presented with headache and fever and was found to have cryptococcal meningitis. During the patient's hospital course, his hemodynamic status deteriorated as a result of pericardial tamponade. Antemortem analysis of the fluid was unrevealing; however, postmortem examination of the pericardium revealed typical intranuclear inclusions of cytomegalovirus infection. Cytomegalovirus should be included in the differential diagnosis of pericardial effusion in patients with AIDS. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Hyperadrenergic orthostatic intolerance as a result of postpartum blood loss. This article describes a young women in whom orthostatic intolerance developed as a result of protracted postpartum vaginal bleeding. The cardiovascular abnormalities were unresponsive to usual treatment measures, and she required combination therapy directed at increasing plasma volume and decreasing sympathetic nervous system activity. After resolution of her symptoms, the patient required no long-term therapy. Chronic blood loss has not been reported as a cause of this syndrome. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Right ventricular infarction: a clinical case study. In this article we review the specific case of Mrs. F., a 63-year-old white woman who recently had classical right ventricular infarction associated with left ventricular inferior wall myocardial infarction. The presentation covers her medical history, clinical course pathophysiology of the right ventricular infarction, and goals of the medical modalities used in treatment. Nursing problems are identified specifically related to right ventricular infarcts, and treatment considerations are discussed. A brief conclusion recaps Mrs. F.'s discharge course and reviews some specific problems associated with right ventricular infarcts, of which critical care nurses need to be aware. "
cardiovascular diseases,Embolism during caesarean section. We investigated the occurrence of gas embolism during Caesarean section using a Doppler ultrasound probe and found that it occurs between uterine incision and delivery. Embolism is less common during general anaesthesia than has been reported during regional anaesthesia. Both ruptured membranes and a protracted uterine incision to delivery interval predispose to embolism. 
cardiovascular diseases,Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: impact of prostanoids in the perioperative period. A prospective study of 10 neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and five controls to determine the importance of prostanoid concentrations perioperatively and the relation with persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is reported. In neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia postoperative concentrations of the vasoconstrictor thromboxane B2 rose significantly and were higher during episodes of PPH; this rise may provoke PPH and subsequent right to left shunting. 
cardiovascular diseases,Retroperitoneal air after routine hemorrhoidectomy. Report of a case. Retroperitoneal air as a complication after routine hemorrhoidectomy has not been reported in the literature. This occurred recently after hemorrhoidectomy in a 34-year-old patient receiving glucocorticoid therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Adverse steroidal effects of wound healing have been well documented. It is believed that steroid-induced tissue changes contributed to the development of this unique complication. 
cardiovascular diseases,"The determination of aortic valve area by the Gorlin formula: what the cardiac sonographer should know. The application of the Gorlin formula in the cardiac catheterization laboratory is the standard of reference for the determination of aortic valve area. The continuity equation now enables the cardiac sonographer to determine aortic valve area noninvasively in the echocardiography laboratory. The comparison of the results obtained by the two methods is inevitable. The cardiac sonographer should have a basic understanding of the theory and pitfalls of the Gorlin formula so that when conflicting results are obtained, the possible reasons why will be clear. "
cardiovascular diseases,Deep venous thrombosis in intravenous cocaine abuse mimicking septic arthritis of the shoulder. We describe two patients with deep venous thrombosis of the upper extremity who initially were thought to have septic arthritis of the shoulder. These patients had a history of recent intravenous cocaine abuse. The diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis should be considered when a patient with a swollen shoulder has an appropriate history. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Dilated cardiomyopathy complicated by a pedunculated and mobile left ventricular thrombus on ruptured false tendons. A 68-year-old man was admitted with congestive heart failure. He was treated with diuretics and digitalis; thereafter, the two-dimensional echocardiogram suggested a pedunculated and mobile left ventricular thrombus. He underwent surgical thrombectomy because of the high risk of systemic embolization. To our knowledge, this is the first case of dilated cardiomyopathy with a mobile left ventricular thrombus that was attached to ruptured false tendons. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Gynecologic vascular abnormalities: diagnosis with Doppler US. The authors describe the use of duplex and/or color Doppler ultrasonography of the pelvis in three women to demonstrate the presence of venous malformations. One patient with a pulsatile vaginal mass was shown to have an arteriovenous malformation of the vaginal wall. The second patient was shown to have an unsuspected venous angioma in the endometrial cavity. The third patient was shown to have adnexal varices that closely mimicked hydrosalpinx. In the latter two cases, the duplex and color flow capabilities of an endovaginal probe were especially important. "
cardiovascular diseases,"High resolution real-time ultrasound for the diagnosis of venous thrombosis in the rehabilitation setting. Accurate, noninvasive testing for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) by conventional methods is often not possible in the rehabilitation patient. Lower extremity amputation, a cast or bandage, or skin problems present obstacles to standard diagnostic methods. This report describes the use of duplex ultrasound (US) scanning for noninvasive diagnosis of DVT in a seventy-year-old man with a below-knee amputation, on whom Doppler and plethysmography examinations could not be performed. As experience is gained with this technique, the use of venography for diagnosis of DVT becomes more difficult to rationalize. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Raynaud's syndrome. Using a range of therapies to help patients. Raynaud's syndrome is a common medical problem. Approach to diagnosis must involve a search for underlying causes. Treatment includes avoidance of precipitating factors, biofeedback, and possibly pharmacologic therapy, after careful consideration of risks. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Admissions to the intensive care unit after complications of anaesthetic techniques over 10 years. 2. The second 5 years Compared with the first 5 years there was a 19% increase in general anaesthetics, a 171% increase in local and (or) sedation techniques and a 9% increase in obstetric epidurals with no increase in anaesthetic staffing. In this second 5-year period, 46 patients were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit as a result of a complication of an anaesthetic technique. These patients represented 1 in 2371 anaesthetic techniques carried out in the District compared with the previous 5 years where the incidence was 1 in 1543. Seven patients died (15.2%). The complication was considered to be wholly or partially avoidable in 14 instances (30.4%). Four of these subjects died. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Patch aortotomy for aortic valve replacement after previous coronary artery bypass grafting. Exposure for aortic valve operations after previous coronary artery bypass grafting may be technically difficult owing to the presence of patent vein grafts on the proximal aorta. A patch or ""island"" aortotomy technique that allows excellent exposure of the aortic valve is presented here. In select patients this approach may facilitate cardioplegia administration. "
cardiovascular diseases,"The fat embolism syndrome. A review. While fat embolism occurs in most (more than 90%) patients with traumatic injury, the fat embolism syndrome (FES) occurs in only 3%-4% of patients with long-bone fractures. FES involves multiple organ systems and can cause a devastating clinical deterioration within hours. The major clinical features of FES include hypoxia, pulmonary edema, central nervous system depression, and axillary or subconjunctive petechiae. Improvements have been made in supporting the respiratory compromise and adult respiratory distress syndrome that these patients develop. Aggressive measures to improve the pulmonary function, i.e., positive pressure ventilation and effective fluid management, are important and expedite fixation of bone fractures. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Giant breast hematoma requiring blood transfusion: an unusual complication after an echocardiographic study during thrombolytic therapy. We report on a patient in whom significant bleeding occurred during thrombolytic therapy. The bleeding occurred after an echocardiographic study, and it resulted in blood transfusion. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Research and policy directions. Salt and blood pressure. The relation between dietary intake of sodium chloride and blood pressure levels remains controversial. The critical questions concern whether there is a susceptible subgroup at risk of elevated blood pressure because of sodium chloride consumption. If there is such a subgroup, what is its size and how can it be identified? Further clinical trials are needed to determine the long-term effects of sodium chloride reduction on blood pressure. The risk of disease, including stroke and coronary heart disease, is linear with blood pressure levels. A small change in blood pressure can have a relatively large impact on disease, even within the normal range of blood pressure. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery. Surgical alternatives depending of the age of the patient. Four cases of anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery, three of which were operated upon in our Centre, are presented. An aortocoronary bypass with reversed autologous saphenous vein was carried out in both of the children; and in the adult, the anomalous ostium was closed from the interior of the pulmonary artery. After 84, 72, and 4 months of evolution, respectively, they were found to be asymptomatic, the mitral insufficiency had disappeared and the venous graft remained patent. In this paper, the clinical form of presentation, diagnostic possibilities and surgical treatment are analysed. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Circumferential quantitative analysis of planar 201T1 myocardial scintigraphy in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Methodology for the computer analysis of 201T1 myocardial perfusion images has been developed by several laboratories. Substantial evidence of the advantage of this approach over visual inspection alone has been reported. The currently available computer analyses use different algorithms to analyze 201T1 kinetics in the myocardium. The authors evaluated and compared two widely used software programs, Medical Data System (MDS): a mean-count profile, and the Cedars Sinai (CS): a maximal-count profile, of planar 201T1 scintigraphy for their ability to detect coronary artery disease (CAD). "
cardiovascular diseases,"Quadricuspid aortic valve and aortic regurgitation diagnosed by Doppler echocardiography: report of two cases and review of the literature. Two cases of patients with quadricuspid aortic valve diagnosed by Doppler echocardiography are presented. Aortic regurgitation was detected by pulsed Doppler echocardiography in both patients. Because they were young patients, this aortic regurgitation indicated that aortic regurgitation is not necessarily a late-developing event, as has been thought previously. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Use of the variable-length intraluminal sutureless graft. From August 1987 to May 1988 we treated 4 patients with acute ascending aortic dissections with a variable-length intraluminal aortic prosthesis. This operation uses profound hypothermic circulatory arrest and represents a refinement of existing techniques. There was no mortality, and morbidity was minimal. Modifications of this technique can be used in performing proximal aortic root reconstruction with a composite valved conduit. The use of a variable-length intraluminal prosthesis and hypothermic circulatory arrest is illustrated. This is a safe and useful technique in select cases of acute ascending aortic dissection. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Complete heart block and severe aortic incompetence in relapsing polychondritis: clinicopathologic findings. We describe a patient with relapsing polychondritis who developed fatal cardiac involvement comprising complete heart block, acute aortic incompetence, and cardiovascular collapse. Pathologic studies showed fibrosis of the cardiac conducting system and necrotizing inflammation of the aortic valve, features not previously described in relapsing polychondritis, as well as evidence of coronary artery vasculitis. "
cardiovascular diseases,A case of lisinopril-induced lithium toxicity We describe a patient who developed lithium toxicity when lisinopril was substituted for clonidine. Possible mechanisms of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced lithium toxicity are discussed. Aggressive serum lithium concentration monitoring and a reduction in the dose of lithium is advised when using ACE inhibitors because of disturbances and shifts in fluid and electrolyte balance. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Are people more health conscious? A longitudinal study of one community. Secular changes in cardiovascular health awareness, knowledge and behavior were observed in four biennial cross-sectional surveys and a cohort survey in a New England community. These changes are not related to more health promotion activities in the social milieu of respondents, but are more likely due to national mass media health campaigns, the effects of which may influence outcomes of community-based cardiovascular disease prevention studies. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Splenic artery aneurysm rupture [published erratum appears in Am J Emerg Med 1991 Mar;9(2):205] Splenic artery aneurysms are rare and usually asymptomatic. However, rupture can produce severe abdominal pain and prove lethal. Two cases of ruptured splenic artery aneurysm are presented. In one, cocaine injection occurred immediately prior to the onset of symptoms and may have precipitated the event. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Assessment of stable ischemic heart disease. Which tests are best for which patients? An understanding of the importance of various risk factors, the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia, and the appropriate use of various noninvasive and invasive tests is essential for management of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). Although coronary angiography remains the ""gold standard"" for diagnosis of CAD, much of the data obtained from risk factor assessment, medical history, and various noninvasive tests provides information that may be even more important than cardiac catheterization data alone for defining prognosis and directing management. "
cardiovascular diseases,"On the inheritance of abdominal aortic aneurysm. To determine the mode of inheritance of abdominal aortic aneurysm, data on first-degree relatives of 91 probands were collected. Results of segregation analysis performed on these data are reported. Many models, including nongenetic and genetic models, were compared using likelihood methods. The nongenetic model was rejected; statistically significant evidence in favor of a genetic model was found. Among the many genetic models compared, the most parsimonious genetic model was that susceptibility to abdominal aortic aneurysm is determined by a recessive gene at an autosomal diallelic major locus. A multifactorial component in addition to the major locus does not increase the likelihood of the data significantly. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Endoscopic laser surgery. A single-center comprehensive experience. A retrospective review of endoscopic procedures using the Nd:YAG laser was carried out for patients treated between October 1985 and March 1989. During this 42-month period 165 procedures were performed on 100 patients. The study encompasses a unique period of time in this center, as it includes the initial application, and finally, the time when its use became routine. Indications for laser surgery included the treatment of tumors, bleeding, benign strictures, arterial occlusions, and hemorrhoids. Nd:YAG laser was found to be effective in the treatment of these lesions. The overall success rate was 81 per cent. Patients who are poor surgical candidates would especially benefit from this therapeutic alternative. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Endocardial resection in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia secondary to cardiac trauma. Sustained ventricular tachycardia with left ventricular aneurysm formation is a rare complication following penetrating cardiac trauma. We present an unusual case of serious ventricular tachycardia which developed 35 years after a World War II injury and was successfully treated with aneurysmectomy, map-guided subendocardial resection, and cryoablation. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Misplaced caval filter and subsequent pericardial tamponade. Use of the Greenfield filter for partial caval interruption is generally accepted as the most reliable mechanical method of pulmonary embolus prophylaxis. However, there have been reports of a variety of (usually nonfatal) complications. We report here the near-fatal complication of acute pericardial tamponade after misplacement of a Greenfield filter. Because of the filter's unusual location, retrieval required cardiopulmonary bypass, profound hyperthermia, and circulatory arrest. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Thrombotic vasculopathy associated with cryofibrinogenemia. Cryofibrinogenemia refers to the presence of cold-precipitable plasma proteins associated with a variety of disorders, including malignancies, inflammatory processes, and thrombohemorrhagic phenomena. Few cases of essential or primary cryofibrinogenemia are reported. We report a case in a 48-year-old man of essential cryofibrinogenemia and hemorrhagic necrosis of the ears and of the upper and lower extremities. Histopathologic studies demonstrated extensive eosinophilic thrombi in the dermal vasculature, with minimal inflammation and no vasculitis. Cryofibrinogenemia should be considered in the investigation of patients with otherwise unexplained cold intolerance and dermal thrombosis associated with minimal or no inflammation. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Cardiac tamponade and contralateral hemothorax after subclavian vein catheterization. A patient developed life-threatening cardiac tamponade and contralateral hemothorax after insertion of a subclavian catheter in the operating room. Contrast was infused through the catheter, demonstrating its malposition in the pericardial space. Contrast infusion was valuable in evaluating this complication of central line placement. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Femoral saphenous vein bypass in a newborn. This is believed to be the youngest patient to undergo a saphenous vein bypass for iatrogenic trauma of the right superficial femoral artery. The infant had emergency right heart catheterisation and Rashkind septostomy for severe desaturation due to transposition of the great arteries. During the exposure of the saphenous vein, the superficial femoral artery was accidentally severed at it's origin. An attempt to restore the circulation by end-to-end anastomosis failed and resulted in persistent limb ischemia for over 4 hours. The baby was reoperated upon, the damaged part of the superficial femoral artery was resected and a saphenous vein graft interposed between the common and the distal superficial femoral artery. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Coronary stent implantation in acute vessel closure 48 hours after an unsatisfactory coronary angioplasty. We report the implantation of a balloon-expandable stent in a patient with acute vessel closure in the state of evolving myocardial infarction following 48 hr after unsatisfactory coronary angioplasty. The stent was implanted after successful recanalization of an occluded left anterior descending artery, with repeated unsatisfactory results of balloon angioplasty. Adjunct thrombolytic therapy was contraindicated. No residual stenosis was documented in immediate control angiograms, or after 24 hr, 3 weeks, and 4 months. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Coronary angioplasty following cardiac transplantation: a case report and review of the literature. A 23-year-old man underwent successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of a severe stenosis of the left anterior descending artery 25 months after orthotopic heart transplantation. Four months later restenosis of the same lesion was treated by repeat PTCA. Angiography 11 months later showed no restenosis. In selected cases, PTCA may be useful in treating allograft coronary disease. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Hypertension in Hispanics, Asians and Pacific-Islanders, and Native Americans. There is a paucity of information about hypertension and its risk factors, prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in many racial minorities in the United States. Most of the population groups discussed in this section are composed of several subgroups that differ culturally, socioeconomically, educationally, and ethnically. This fact, however, does not lessen the need for more information about the extent of hypertension and risk factors in these groups. Moreover, a bonus from expanded research in these areas will be new information useful to the general population. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Total occlusion of the left main coronary artery in a young woman with survival: a case report. The total occlusion of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) is rare, and the survival depends on the existence of collateral circulation. The author presents a case of total occlusion of the left main coronary artery with survival in a young woman because he thinks this is a very rare case, owing to the sex and age of the patient. "
cardiovascular diseases,Left ventricular rupture complicating percutaneous mitral commissurotomy: salvage using percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass support. Left ventricular rupture resulting in death has been reported to be a complication of percutaneous mitral commissurotomy. We report a 71-year-old man in whom a left ventricular rupture occurred during percutaneous mitral commissurotomy and resulted in hemodynamic collapse due to acute cardiac tamponade. The patient was stabilized using percutaneously instituted cardiopulmonary bypass support with subsequent repair of the left ventricle and successful mitral valve replacement. Three months later this patient remains in New York Heart Class I. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Nitrendipine-induced gingival hyperplasia. First case report. Drug-induced gingival hyperplasia is well documented within the literature. It has been associated with phenytoin, cyclosporine, and calcium channel blocking agents. Nitrendipine is an experimental calcium channel blocking agent that also appears to cause the side effect of drug-induced gingival hyperplasia. The clinical and histologic presentation of this side effect and possible biochemical mechanisms of pathogenesis are discussed. "
cardiovascular diseases,"New developments in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Since the last revision of the American Heart Association's guidelines in 1985, several new developments of clinical importance have occurred in the field of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. These include enhanced access to and earlier use of defibrillation, the use of high-dose epinephrine when standard doses fail, the assessment of resuscitative efforts with end-tidal CO2 monitoring and the addition of two new drugs, amiodarone (for refractory ventricular fibrillation) and adenosine (for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia). Time will determine the ultimate role of these advancements in the management of cardiac arrest. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Conjunctival involvement in pemphigus vulgaris: a clinical, histopathological and immunofluorescence study. Eleven patients with pemphigus vulgaris and with eye complaints had histopathological and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) studies on biopsies of their conjunctivae. In eight of the patients the ocular symptoms preceded the other manifestations of pemphigus. None of the 11 patients had any detectable conjunctival blisters or erosions. The conjunctivitis in three of the patients proved on histopathology and DIF to be a manifestation of pemphigus vulgaris. In the remaining patients, conjunctival hyperaemia with or without a mucoid discharge was observed, but there were no specific histopathological features, although one of them had a positive DIF. "
cardiovascular diseases,Pulmonary hypertension five years after left pneumonectomy for adenoid cystic carcinoma. We report the findings in a patient with shortness of breath due to pulmonary hypertension five years after left pneumonectomy. Mediastinal recurrence of an incompletely resected and slowly growing adenoid cystic carcinoma of the left main bronchus had encased the right main pulmonary artery. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Percutaneous balloon pulmonic valvuloplasty following treated endocarditis in a patient with congenital pulmonary valve stenosis. A 36-year-old woman with congenital pulmonary valve stenosis developed the rare complication of endocarditis of the valve. After successful sterilization of the valve, the patient underwent percutaneous balloon pulmonic valvuloplasty at a later date. The procedure successfully reduced the peak pulmonary valve gradient from 94 to 45 mm Hg. Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty is the procedure of choice for treatment of congenital pulmonary valvular stenosis, even in the unusual patient who has healed endocarditis of the pulmonary valve. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Therapeutic cardiac catheterization in children Cardiac catheterization, once the mainstay of diagnosis in children with congenital heart disease, has become a therapeutic modality for many conditions. Balloon dilatation can now open stenotic valves and vessels, coils and umbrellas can now close unwanted communications, and emboli can be withdrawn without surgical intervention. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Fatal pulmonary embolism caused by streptokinase treatment of deep venous thrombosis of the leg? During the last 10 years, four of 150 (2.7%) patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) treated with streptokinase (SK) at our department have died of pulmonary embolism (PE). A retrospective study of 1393 DVT patients treated with heparin during the period 1973-1986 showed that five (0.36%) of these patients died of PE while still on heparin. In this paper we describe the four patients treated with SK who developed fatal PE. In our opinion this increase in mortality does not warrant the use of SK in routine treatment of DVT of the leg before a proper trial has been conducted to compare the frequencies of pulmonary embolism after both treatments. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Calcium antagonists in the management of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a review. Cerebral arterial vasospasm and infarction is the leading cause of death and disability among patients who reach a major medical center after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Recent evidence suggests that two calcium antagonists, nimodipine or nicardipine, may be useful in preventing this important complication of SAH. This paper reviews the current status of these two calcium antagonists in the management of SAH. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Acute myocardial infarction resulting from the migration of a Greenfield filter. A paraplegic patient who underwent the placement of Greenfield filters to prevent pulmonary emboli had one of the filters migrate proximally to the junction of the inferior vena cava and right atrium, then into the right atrium a few months later. This resulted in an acute myocardial infarction by apparently causing an intimal dissection of the posterior descending artery. Treatment, follow-up and causes of filter migration are discussed. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Regression of the left main trunk lesion by steroid administration in Takayasu's aortitis. A 62-year-old man with unstable angina due to severe narrowing of the left main trunk (LMT) was examined. Emergency bypass surgery was performed with an internal mammary artery graft, instead of a saphenous vein graft, because of the thickened, edematous ascending aorta. Postoperative coronary angiography showed the lesion of the LMT markedly regressing. Presumably, this stenotic lesion of the LMT was caused by active aortitis and was partially reversible by steroid administration both during and after surgery. Steroid therapy can be added to the list of treatments for cases of LMT disease associated with Takayasu's aortitis, if signs of active inflammation are present. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Two-dimensional echocardiographic features of double outlet left ventricle. In a cyanotic newborn infant, the diagnosis of double outlet left ventricle was made from the two-dimensional echocardiographic examination. The diagnosis was later confirmed at cardiac catheterization and surgery. The parasternal and subcostal views were especially useful for identification of the origin of both great arteries from the morphologic left ventricle. A review of the medical literature since 1967 revealed 77 cases of double outlet left ventricle, most of which were diagnosed only at surgery or postmortem examination. The anatomic features demonstrated with two-dimensional echocardiography in this case are representative of the findings cited most often in the cases reported in the medical literature. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Triggers of transient myocardial ischemia: circadian variation and relation to plaque rupture and coronary thrombosis in stable coronary artery disease. The phenomenon of transient myocardial ischemia is common in patients with stable coronary disease and appears to be due both to increases in myocardial demand and to episodic coronary vasoconstriction. The circadian variation of transient ischemic episodes closely parallels the circadian variation of acute coronary syndromes associated with plaque rupture, such as myocardial infarction and sudden death. These concordant temporal patterns of transient ischemia, myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death probably represent independent manifestations stemming from the consequences of increased sympathetic activity. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Hyponatraemia secondary to an inappropriately high release of antidiuretic hormone in cardiac tamponade. A spontaneous intrapericardial haemorrhage caused cardiac tamponade in a 29 year old paraplegic man who was being treated with warfarin. The associated persistent hyponatraemia, which was believed to be caused by an inappropriately high release of antidiuretic hormone, rapidly resolved after pericardiocentesis. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Resistance to ischaemia of small afferent nerve fibres in diabetes mellitus. Thermal thresholds were measured in the left forearms of 26 healthy subjects and 10 patients with diabetes mellitus during ischaemic compression block. During the period when ischaemic block of large fibres caused paraesthesia and loss of touch sensation, the cold threshold rose in normals. The cold threshold was less clearly elevated and the warm perception remained unaltered by ischaemia in diabetics. These results show that not only large afferent and efferent nerve fibres but also thinly myelinated A delta and unmyelinated C fibres are resistant to ischaemia in the diabetic nerve. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Gastric antral vascular ectasia (""watermelon stomach""): radiologic findings. Radiologic findings in a patient with gastric antral vascular ectasia are described on computed tomographic scans, upper gastrointestinal series, and specimen radiographs. Findings include prominent, scalloped antral folds radiating to the pylorus and thickening of the gastric antrum. Pathognomonic red vascular folds, likened to stripes on a watermelon, can be seen endoscopically. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Optimizing heparin utilization in angiographic flush solutions. Various concentrations of heparin in angiographic flush solutions are employed during angiography. In an effort to determine whether differences in outcome are seen when either high or low concentrations of heparin in angiographic flush solutions are utilized, two groups of patients were evaluated. There was no difference in outcome and a small systemic effect from heparin was seen in both groups. Use of a low concentration of heparin is suggested for routine angiography. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Successful treatment of an excimer laser-associated coronary artery perforation with the Stack perfusion catheter. A 64-year-old woman underwent excimer laser angioplasty of the right coronary artery. The procedure was complicated by perforation, which was successfully managed without complication with a Stack perfusion catheter. This report describes successful nonsurgical treatment of laser-induced coronary perforation and makes recommendations for avoiding this complication in other patients. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Venous ulcers: pathophysiology and medical therapy. Venous ulcers may occur as a result of lower extremity calf pump failure, with ensuing edema, trapping of white blood cells and deposition of pericapillary fibrin. Acute, smaller lesions are easily treated with adequate compression and occlusive dressings. Larger, more chronic wounds often benefit from some form of external compression. Occlusive dressings and local wound care are most effective when used simultaneously with compression. Sequential compression pumps merit study and may prove to be of therapeutic and prophylactic value. In refractory cases, long-term use of compression devices may be required to prevent ulcer recurrence. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Thyrotoxicosis induced by topical iodine application. We describe an elderly man who was admitted with congestive cardiac failure and found to have thyrotoxicosis. He did not have goiter, and he had normal radioiodine uptake in his neck. Serum iodine levels were elevated, explaining the lack of increase in radioiodine uptake in the thyroid gland. He had multiple pressure sores, which were treated with povidone-iodine (Betadine) soaks. Biochemical data were consistent with Graves' disease unmasked by topical iodine application. Povidone-iodine soaks are commonly used in decubitus ulcer care and warrant special attention in patients with preexisting thyroid disorders. We have reviewed the literature on this unusual complication. "
cardiovascular diseases,Total left main coronary artery occlusion after aortic aneurysm repair and valve replacement. A 38-year-old woman with complete occlusion of the left main coronary artery secondary to cannulation during aortic valve replacement is presented. The clinical course was characterized by progressive left ventricular dysfunction and congestive heart failure. Recognition of this potential problem when it occurs is important as to institute therapeutic measures which may interrupt a patient's progressive clinical deterioration. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Cardiac conducting tissue. A simplified technique for examination of the SA and AV nodes. We describe a modified method for examination of the atrioventricular and sinoatrial nodes that displays the major elements of the cardiac conducting system, yet is not time-consuming for the technician. We examined 31 cases in three categories: cases with previous cardiac history, sudden deaths from no known cause, and cases where death was sudden and accidental. All cases showed histologic abnormalities in the cardiac tissue. We contend that our method would permit such examination to be routinely used in the pathology laboratory. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Cardiovascular sequelae of therapeutic thoracic radiation. Mediastinal radiation damages endothelial cells, with resulting loss of capillaries and ischemia at the level of the microcirculation. These changes lead to increases in collagen and proliferation of fibrous tissue throughout the heart. Cardiac dysfunction following radiotherapy is surprisingly common and may be due to pericardial, myocardial, valvular, conduction system, or coronary artery disease. Greater awareness of cardiotoxicity has prompted changes in radiation techniques that appear to reduce clinical cardiovascular complications. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Heart weights of white men 20 to 39 years of age. An analysis of 218 autopsy cases. Review of autopsy data for 218 white men between 20 and 39 years of age who died of injuries or suddenly and unexpectedly indicated a mean heart weight of 371 g. The mean for those dying of external causes was 364 g whereas the mean for those dying of natural causes was 446 g. A coefficient for heart weight expressed as a percentage of body weight was lower in heavy individuals than lightweight individuals; it ranged between 0.38% and 0.55%, with a mean of 0.48%. Heart weight, including epicardial fat, increased with age and body weight. These data may be useful to those who are called upon to investigate sudden and unexpected deaths. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Effects of calcium on vascular smooth muscle tone. It is generally acknowledged that calcium plays a major role in the generation of vascular tone. However, in recent years it has become increasingly evident that relatively calcium-insensitive pathways of excitation-contraction coupling also exist in the vascular smooth muscle cell. Possible mechanisms of vascular smooth muscle contraction and their possible role in the pathophysiology of hypertension are reviewed. The rationale for the use of calcium channel blockers in the treatment of hypertension is discussed. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Aortic dissection with a fistulous communication into the right atrium: a case report. A case of aortic dissection (type 1, De Bakey) with a rent into the right atrium (RA), diagnosed by echocardiography (echo) and confirmed by aortography, is reported. The patient presented with cardiac failure and a continuous murmur in the right second and third intercostal spaces. The patient has survived for two years with medial treatment. "
cardiovascular diseases,Vertebrobasilar occlusion following minor trauma in an 8-year-old boy. An 8-year-old boy developed seizures and coma 2 days after a trivial bicycle accident. Computed tomography failed to show pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed infarction of the pons and right cerebellum. Angiography showed occlusion of the right vertebral and basilar arteries. Minor traumatic injuries to the cervical spine may result in vertebrobasilar occlusion. The neurologic manifestations of this disorder and emergency department diagnosis and management are discussed. 
cardiovascular diseases,Presentation of breast carcinoma as Volkmann's contracture due to skeletal muscle metastases. Metastases to the skeletal muscles are extremely rare. They usually occur during the course of a pulmonary or digestive carcinoma. We describe a case of breast carcinoma presenting with forearm muscle metastases and Volkmann's type contracture. 
cardiovascular diseases,Endocarditis due to ampicillin-resistant nontyphoid Salmonella: cure with a third-generation cephalosporin. A case of ampicillin-resistant salmonella bacteremia complicated by endocarditis in a 78-year-old man is presented. Previous rheumatic valvular heart disease and the lack of response to initial treatment with chloramphenicol prompted us to consider this diagnosis. There was a good clinical response after treatment with ceftriaxone alone and corresponding improvement on the echocardiogram. This case demonstrates the possible endovascular complications of salmonella bacteremia in elderly people and that endocarditis should be included among the invasive infections due to ampicillin-resistant Salmonella that could potentially be treated with the newer cephalosporins. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Spontaneous regression of cardiomyopathy in a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Cardiac involvement is common in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and, when symptomatic, it portends a poor prognosis. We present a case of marked spontaneous regression of cardiomyopathy in a patient with AIDS. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of spontaneous recovery of ventricular function in an AIDS patient. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Clinical association of autoantibodies to fibrillarin with diffuse scleroderma and disseminated telangiectasia. Circulating autoantibodies against a variety of nuclear and nucleolar antigens are characteristic serologic findings in systemic scleroderma. Some of these antibodies correlate with clinical subsets of the disease. We describe three patients with systemic scleroderma and high autoantibody titers against U3 ribonucleoprotein-associated fibrillarin, a recently identified 34 kD nucleolar protein. These patients showed a progressive course with multiple organ and diffuse skin involvement with disseminated telangiectasia. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Newer antihypertensive agents. Three recent additions to the list of antihypertensive agents have been approved for use as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs. Betaxolol hydrochloride (Kerlone) maintains its effect for 24 hours, making it a true once-a-day beta blocker. Penbutolol sulfate (Levatol) is as effective as other beta blockers and diuretics. Doxazosin mesylate (Cardura), a selective alpha 1 blocker, also allows once-a-day dosing and has produced favorable changes in lipid profiles. Two new drug delivery systems, one for verapamil hydrochloride (Verelan) and one for extended-release nifedipine (Procardia XL), allow less frequent dosing and may offer other advantages, such as greater compliance and a more tolerable side-effect profile. "
cardiovascular diseases,"An unusual complication of cardiac transplantation--infected aortic pseudoaneurysm. Infections after cardiac transplantation are a frequent cause of early morbidity and mortality. An unusual site for such a complication is at the aortic anastomotic suture line. We report a case of an infected aortic pseudoaneurysm, seen as recurrent septicemia, during the first 6 months after cardiac transplantation. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Cerebral air embolism treated by pressure and hyperbaric oxygen. We used pressure and hyperbaric oxygen to treat 2 patients with cerebral air embolism, occurring as the result of invasive medical procedures, and neither suffered any permanent damage detectable by clinical examination and MRI. This outcome contrasts with reports of infarct and disability among untreated victims of air embolism. "
cardiovascular diseases,Surgical repair of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome complicated with myocardial bridging. Myocardial bridging causes myocardial ischemia during supraventricular tachycardia. We present a case of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome combined with myocardial bridging. The patient complained of angina pectoris during paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia because of severe constriction of the left anterior descending coronary artery during systole. A myocardial scintigram revealed myocardial ischemia in the anteroseptal wall during paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Myotomy to prevent myocardial bridging and interruption of the accessory conduction pathway was successfully accomplished in a one-stage operation. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Wegener's granulomatosis presenting as temporal arteritis. A granulomatous giant cell vasculitis of the temporal artery was observed in a biopsy specimen from a patient with corresponding clinical symptoms. Within weeks, the new onset of pulmonary infiltrates and renal failure prompted biopsy of the patient's kidney. A necrotizing glomerulonephritis, compatible with a diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, was present. Vasculitis of the temporal artery may be a feature of Wegener's granulomatosis. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Rebleeding from intracranial dissecting aneurysm in the vertebral artery. We describe two patients with rebleeding from intracranial vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms during the acute stage. One patient had excellent results after emergency surgery. A review of recent reports including 60 patients with this disorder revealed a rebleeding rate of 30%, mostly during the acute stage. This suggests that a ruptured dissecting aneurysm in the vertebral artery is at risk for rebleeding during the acute stage, similar to a saccular aneurysm in the same location. "
cardiovascular diseases,Florid pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. A young woman presented with rapidly progressive dyspnea and clinical findings strongly suggestive of primary pulmonary hypertension or possible pulmonary embolism (or both). She died of acute right-sided heart failure. A diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease was made at autopsy. Approximately 100 cases of this disease have been reported previously in the literature. We describe a patient with a particularly florid progression of this unusual disease. Death occurred within six weeks of the onset of symptoms. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Disseminated Conidiobolus infection with endocarditis in a cocaine abuser. A crack cocaine abuser developed disseminated infection caused by a species of Conidiobolus not known to cause disease in vertebrates. The fungus gained entry via skin abrasions on the lower extremities, spread through the hematogenous route, and caused endocarditis. There was evidence of fungal infection in the lungs, heart, kidneys, skeletal muscles, and brain. An additional complication was extensive rhabdomyolysis, with a marked elevation of creatine kinase of up to 1.2 million U/L. "
cardiovascular diseases,"When is pulmonary artery catheterization worth the risks? Bedside pulmonary artery catheterization has proven to be an important addition to the clinical assessment of critically ill patients. Properly used, the procedure may provide hemodynamic information that is not apparent from physical examination or radiography. It may be safely accomplished through various venous routes, but care must be taken to avoid potential complications. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Intrapericardial infusion of 5-fluorouracil. An unusual complication of a Hickman catheter. Venous access devices (VAD) have become an important tool in the management of patients with cancer. Multiple complications can occur as a consequence of insertion of a VAD. The authors report a case of a Hickman catheter perforating the wall of the superior vena cava into the pericardium, resulting in accidental intrapericardial infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias developed, but the patient did not have cardiac tamponade. She recovered from the event without apparent chronic cardiac dysfunction. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Mixed connective tissue disease with arterial thrombosis, antiphospholipid antibodies and heparin induced thrombocytopenia. We report a patient with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) who presented with thrombosis of the right femoral artery in association with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). When treated surgically and with heparin prophylaxis, she developed heparin induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis which necessitated amputation of a lower limb. Thus our patient developed 2 separate groups of autoantibodies associated with thrombotic events. Our case highlights an association between thrombosis, aPL and MCTD. Furthermore, it emphasizes a need for intensive monitoring when hypercoaguable individuals with connective tissue disorders are treated with heparin. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Hemodynamic effects of H2-receptor antagonists. Histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) often are administered to intensive care unit patients in an attempt to reduce gastric acidity and to prevent stress-related mucosal damage. These agents have an extremely low overall incidence and severity of adverse reactions; however, hemodynamically significant hypotension has been noted. Clinical studies with rapidly administered intravenous cimetidine in critically ill patients have demonstrated a depression in blood pressure in up to 75 percent of patients. Ranitidine, also studied in this setting, does not appear to induce similar hemodynamic changes. The newer H2RAs, famotidine and nizatidine, have not been evaluated in critically ill patients. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Silent myocardial ischemia: dilemma or blessing? Developing an optimal strategy for the evaluation and management of patients with silent myocardial ischemia is extremely difficult. Although otherwise healthy, asymptomatic individuals may be at risk of dying suddenly during exercise, neither exercise testing nor Holter monitoring reliably identifies those at greatest risk. In patients with underlying coronary artery disease, silent ischemia increases the risk of an adverse outcome. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Lower extremity arterial disease in systemic lupus erythematosus. Lupus vasculitis primarily affects microvascular circulation, and large-vessel thrombosis is a rare complication of this disease. Large-vessel occlusive disease in systemic lupus erythematosus is most likely related to hypercoagulability in addition to immune complex-mediated endothelial damage. We describe the 11th and 12th patients reported to have systemic lupus erythematosus and macrovascular occlusive disease of the lower extremities. Our experience and a review of the literature suggest that, while aortoiliac disease is amenable to bypass or endarterectomy, infrainguinal disease is rarely correctable surgically, and amputation becomes necessary in most of these patients. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Salvage from cardiogenic shock by atherectomy after failed emergency coronary artery angioplasty. In this case report of a patient undergoing angioplasty for cardiogenic shock during acute myocardial infarction, recurrent occlusion resulted in recurrence of shock. Atherectomy reestablished lasting patency and reversed the patient's hemodynamic collapse. Atherectomy deserves further investigation as a means to salvage vessel patency during unsuccessful coronary angioplasty. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Acquired retinal arteriovenous communications in occlusive disease of the carotid artery. Retinal arteriovenous communications proximal to extensive areas of complete vascular closure developed in three patients with occlusive disease of the carotid arteries. In one case, the authors document the development of the arteriovenous communications through successive enlargement of small retinal vessels after progressive signs of retinal ischemia in the form of narrowed retinal arteries, venous dilation and beading, microaneurysms, retinal dot and blot hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, and capillary nonperfusion. The development of arteriovenous communications in carotid occlusive disease has not been described previously. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Clinical controversies surrounding thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction. The treatment of acute myocardial infarction has changed tremendously in the past decade because thrombolytic therapy has become the treatment of choice for the patient with acute myocardial infarction. Although many issues have been resolved, several controversial issues remain unresolved. This article addresses thrombolytic agents in terms of their superiority in achieving infarct vessel patency and mortality reduction as well as the role of thrombolysis in patients who present with chest pain of greater than 6 hours' duration, who are elderly, and who have an inferior infarction. "
cardiovascular diseases,Treatment of congenital coronary arteriovenous malformations with micro-particle embolization. The successful treatment of a symptomatic coronary arteriovenous malformation (CAVM) by a percutaneous embolization technique with micro-particles is described. Objective evidence of ischemia and its subsequent disappearance after embolization is presented. The embolization technique and possible indications and contraindications are discussed. 
cardiovascular diseases,Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of anomalous right coronary artery. Coronary angioplasty of tortuous anomalous coronary arteries can be technically challenging. We describe a successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of an anomalous right coronary artery after a failed previous attempt. The anatomic limitations of anomalous right coronary arteries and technical considerations for PTCA are discussed. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Non-drug related asystole associated with anaesthetic induction. A patient is presented where routine venepuncture associated with anaesthetic induction resulted in bradycardia and asystole. The case highlights the need for special caution with, and ECG monitoring throughout induction for, patients with a history of syncope. It also demonstrates the need for caution when attributing cardiovascular events during induction to the effect of the induction agents used. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Acute dissection of the internal mammary artery: a fatal complication of coronary artery bypass grafting. A case of acute traumatic dissection of the right internal mammary artery is presented in a patient who had both IMAs grafted for recurrent angina 10 years after initial vein coronary revascularisation. The event was mistaken for spasm, but because of severe circulatory collapse no time was available to treat the patient appropriately. The purpose of this report is to facilitate the early recognition and avoidance of this potentially fatal complication. "
cardiovascular diseases,The surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation. IV. Surgical technique. The operative technique for the current surgical procedure of creating an electrical maze for the treatment of atrial fibrillation is described in a sequential fashion. The accompanying diagrams of the procedure are drawn from the view of the operating surgeon. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm with hemoptysis. A 53-year-old man who had previously undergone resection of a left ventricular aneurysm was admitted because of hemoptysis. Preoperative evaluation with computed tomographic scan and cardiac catheterization demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm of the inferior ventricular wall measuring 16 cm in diameter with protrusion into the left hemithorax. The neck of the pseudoaneurysm was a defect in the ventricular wall extending from the base of the mitral valve annulus to the insertion of the posterior papillary muscle. Operative repair was performed using an albumin-coated, low-porosity Dacron patch. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Disappearance of renin-induced proteinuria by an ACE-inhibitor: a case report. A 55-year-old man developed renovascular hypertension that was characterized by high plasma renin activity. This was accompanied by nephrotic range proteinuria. Treatment with nifedipine and furosemide lowered the blood pressure to normal values, but proteinuria persisted. However, treatment with an ACE-inhibitor brought resolution of the proteinuria, suggesting a role for angiotensin II in urinary protein loss. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Intravascular ultrasound imaging of an acute dissecting aortic aneurysm: a case report. A case of acute dissecting aortic aneurysm is described in which intravascular ultrasonography was used at the time of aortography to produce real-time, 360 degree cross-sectional images of the aorta. The transmural vessel morphology visualized by this new catheter-based technology allowed confirmation of the diagnosis and identification of distal extension to the aortic bifurcation. The case demonstrates the unique potential of this modality in diagnosis and possible therapy in vascular diseases. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Splinter hemorrhages as a possible clinical manifestation of cholesterol crystal embolization. We describe a patient with cholesterol crystal embolization who demonstrated splinter hemorrhages of multiple fingernails and toenails as part of her clinical presentations. Our patient's clinical presentation, and review of the medical literature, raise the possibility that cholesterol crystal embolization may be associated with splinter hemorrhages. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Femorofemoral bypass: a profile of graft failure. We have reviewed our experience with 71 patients who had a femorofemoral bypass for unilateral iliac artery occlusion or stenosis. We analyzed morbidity, mortality, initial relief of symptoms, early patency, and long-term primary and secondary patency; and we attempted to identify the cause of graft failure. The overall hospital mortality after operative repair was 4%. One-year survival was 84% and 2-year survival was 81%. Early patency was 98.5% at 1 month, late patency was 91% at 1 year and 82% at 5 years. The major cause of graft failure was inadequate run-off and outflow disease progression. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Ultrasound demonstration of a superior mesenteric artery aneurysm in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. A large aneurysm of the superior mesenteric artery was the presumed cause of abdominal pain in an 11-year-old girl with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This aneurysm was readily identified by ultrasonography, suggesting that this method could be the diagnostic technique of choice in this disorder. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Surgical resection of cor triatriatum in a 74-year-old man. Review of echocardiographic findings with emphasis on Doppler and transesophageal echocardiography. A 74-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with congestive heart failure secondary to cor triatriatum. He also had sick sinus syndrome with complete heart block and syncope that had been treated with a permanent pacemaker 20 years earlier. The patient underwent successful surgical resection of the atrial membrane with closure of an atrial septal defect. M-mode, two-dimensional, Doppler, and transesophageal echocardiographic findings are reviewed. A unique ""spike and dome"" pattern on continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography is described that may suggest diagnosis of cor triatriatum. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Myocarditis simulating acute transmural myocardial infarction. A patient with cardiogenic shock had typical electrocardiographic findings of acute anterior transmural myocardial infarction. Cardiac catheterization revealed normal coronary arteries and severe biventricular failure. Postmortem examination confirmed normal coronary arteries; acute myocarditis, but no evidence for infarction, was found. Electrocardiographic changes of myocarditis may be indistinguishable from acute transmural infarction. In suspected cases, cardiac catheterization should be considered prior to thrombolytic therapy. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Recurrent intracaval renal cell carcinoma: the role of intravascular ultrasonography. The presence of extension into the vena cava does not preclude curative resection for extensive renal cell carcinomas. However, preoperative assessment of (1) the proximal extent of the tumor and (2) the degree of adherence within the vena cava is necessary to plan operative strategies. The following report describes the successful use of intravascular ultrasonography in the preoperative evaluation of a patient with recurrent renal cell carcinoma with vena caval extension. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Oral contraception in disease states. Oral contraceptives are clearly contraindicated in patients with a history of thromboembolic disease, ischemic heart attack, or cerebral stroke. Patients requiring long-term anticoagulant treatment can be treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs to prevent ovulation, because ruptured follicles can cause massive intraperitoneal bleeding. Patients with essential hypertension and severe liver diseases should also discontinue treatment 4 weeks before major elective surgery. Migraine and diabetes mellitus are regarded as relative contraindications, depending on the individual situation. Long-term diseases, such as Crohn's disease, epilepsy, and sickle cell anemia, also require individualized consultation. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Scatter photocoagulation restores tissue hypoxia in experimental vasoproliferative microangiopathy in miniature pigs. Experimental retinal branch vein occlusion using argon laser photocoagulation in miniature pigs induced the development of ischemic retinal territories associated with preretinal neovascularization. Preretinal partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) measurements on the ischemic territories, using O2-sensitive microelectrodes, established that the ischemic retinal areas were hypoxic. Scatter photocoagulation of these ischemic hypoxic territories restores the local PO2 to the normal values within 2 weeks. Hence, the reported inhibitory effect of photocoagulation on the development of retinal neovascularization could be due to a reversal effect on tissue hypoxia. "
cardiovascular diseases,Streptococcal antibody cross-reactivity with HLA-DR4+VE B-lymphocytes. Basis of the DR4 associated genetic predisposition to rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease? [published erratum appears in Br J Rheumatol 1991 Jun;30(3):222] B-lymphocytes obtained from patients with either rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease and from normal subjects were reacted with serum obtained from rabbits immunized with streptococcal cell wall antigen. The presence of cytotoxicity was sought using an inverted phase microscope after differential uptake of eosin dye. The serum was found to be significantly more cytotoxic to HLA-DR4 containing cells of both patients and normals compared with DR4 negative cells (P less than 0.0001). 
cardiovascular diseases,"Role of angioplasty in myocardial infarction management strategies: a review. The role of angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction has been extensively studied in the past few years. Although angioplasty in some circumstances can be the primary reperfusion intervention, logistic problems and the excellent results of intravenous thrombolytic therapy have resulted in postlytic angioplasty being the preferred use of this interventional strategy. Clinical trials of this strategy have not supported its routine use, however, and a much more selective application of postthrombolytic coronary artery dilation is advocated at this time. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Pathophysiological insights into the cardiomyopathy of Chagas' disease. The evidence gained from both human and animal studies of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy suggests that the disease occurs as a consequence of several discrete and progressive pathophysiological processes occurring after infection, the ultimate expression of which depends on a host of unidentified factors. Collectively, the infection-associated events compromise microvasculature function and result in hypoperfusion, with consequences indistinguishable from those observed in other, nonparasitological cardiomyopathic diseases secondary to hypoperfusion. Therefore, chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy may share similar pathophysiological abnormalities with other chronic congestive cardiomyopathic states. "
cardiovascular diseases,Treatment of severe acne with isotretinoin in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Four patients with inflammatory bowel disease and severe cystic acne were treated with isotretinoin. Two patients had a successful course of treatment without any gastrointestinal side-effects. One patient had two episodes of profuse rectal bleeding that were probably related to pre-existing haemorrhoids. The fourth patient had a flare-up of his Crohn's disease after starting isotretinoin. 
cardiovascular diseases,Coronary artery aneurysm without stenosis in association with Osler-Weber-Rendu disease--a case report. A fifty-three-year-old woman presented with coronary artery aneurysm in association with Osler-Weber-Rendu disease (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) manifested also by large pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas. The arterial dye dilution curves were unusually distorted owing to the right-to-left shunts. The coronary artery aneurysm was located in multiple sites but was not accompanied by stenotic lesions. Coronary artery aneurysm without stenosis is a rare pathologic state and has not been previously reported in association with hereditary telangiectasia. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Excimer laser angioplasty during aortocoronary bypass grafting. Laser coronary angioplasty using the 308-nm Excimer laser was successfully performed intraoperatively during coronary artery bypass grafting. It achieved a reduction of the left anterior descending artery stenosis from 99% to 25% as seen on angioscopy, without evidence of vascular perforation or intimal disruption. The Excimer laser offers the opportunity for intraoperative endovascular remodeling and recanalization and has a potential role as an adjunct to existing standard coronary artery bypass grafting protocol. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Surgical presentation of Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome). Five patients with Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome) are reported whose varied presentations included acute abdominal pain, peripheral arterial aneurysms, digital gangrene and sterile pyuria and whose presenting pathology ranged from hydrops of the gallbladder to enteric pseudo-obstruction. As the complications of the disease can usually be managed without resort to surgery, which is associated with a mortality rate of up to 25 per cent, the recognition of Kawasaki disease will prevent hazardous and unnecessary laparotomy. "
cardiovascular diseases,"The cardiovascular effects of cocaine. Cocaine use and abuse continue to overwhelm urban economic, social, and health care systems. Patients frequently present to the emergency department with life-threatening manifestations of cocaine use, including trauma, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, psychomotor agitation, and cardiovascular collapse. Adequate treatment of the cocaine-intoxicated patient requires a critical understanding of the risk-to-benefit ratios for pharmacologic, toxicologic, and surgical or obstetric interventions. The pharmacologic and physiologic bases for the vascular manifestations of cocaine toxicity and experimental evidence for treatment strategies are reviewed. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Electrocardiographic J waves after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. A patient was monitored prior to, during, and after cardiac arrest with a Holter monitor and an electrocardiograph. The arrest occurred without any premonitory signs on the ECG. At the onset of the arrest, torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia occurred, which quickly degenerated into ventricular fibrillation. After a successful second defibrillation, the patient developed Osborn waves, which subsided within a few minutes. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Deficiency of calcitonin gene-related peptide in Raynaud's phenomenon. Skin biopsy samples from the fingers of nine patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon, nine with the disorder associated with systemic sclerosis, and eleven healthy controls were examined by immunocytochemistry. There were no differences between the groups in the distribution of PGP 9.5 (a pan-neuronal marker) immunoreactivity, but there was a significant reduction in the number of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactive neurons in the skin of patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon and those with systemic sclerosis. These findings implicate dysfunction of the CGRP neurovascular axis in the pathophysiology of Raynaud's phenomenon. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Epidural anaesthesia for labour and caesarean section in a parturient with a single ventricle and transposition of the great arteries. We describe a case of a 29-year-old parturient with a single ventricle and transposition of the great arteries who had lumbar epidural analgesia/anaesthesia with a local anaesthetic for labour, emergency Caesarean section and postoperative pain. Her outcome and that of her baby was successful. The anaesthetic techniques used in other parturients with similar congenital cardiac anomalies are reviewed. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Hot-tip laser. Results and complications. The hot tip laser system for atheroablation has been used since mid-1984 as a device for broadening the indications for and extending the applicability of angioplasty in the management of lower-extremity atherosclerosis. It has been a controversial device. Although the system demonstrates that it can occasionally be useful for the management of occlusive as opposed to stenotic disease of the infrainguinal arteries, a close examination of the published data fails to demonstrate a consistent improvement in either the primary success or long-term patency rates for thermal energy applied to atheroma for recanalization of the lower extremity arteries. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Vascular lesions of the intestines. This article reviews the pathology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of vascular lesions of the intestine as a cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. In addition, a modified system for classifying such lesions, based on the author's personal experience with such lesions, is presented. "
cardiovascular diseases,Percutaneous extraction of fractured guidewire from distal right coronary artery. The incidence of retained hardware components in the coronary artery tree is likely to parallel the growing number and types of percutaneous coronary revascularization procedures being performed. Management has extended from the conservative option of simply leaving behind the retained components to the more aggressive approach of surgical removal. A percutaneous method is described herein which offers the interventional cardiologist an alternative method of managing patients with retained wire fragments contained entirely in the coronary artery. 
cardiovascular diseases,Left atrial bacterial mural endocarditis. An unusual case of Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis confined to the mural left atrium is presented. Echocardiographic studies revealed a 1.5 x 2.0-cm vegetation mimicking a myxoma situated in the path of a mitral regurgitant jet on a color Doppler test. Emboli to upper and lower extremities and brain complicated the patient's preoperative course. Surgical excision and pathologic examination confirmed this rare occurrence. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Acute pulmonary oedema following administration of ornithine-8-vasopressin. We report the case of a patient who developed acute pulmonary oedema following a short and uneventful surgical procedure. Among the differential diagnoses, the role of ornithine-8-vasopressin is emphasized. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Thromboembolism. A complication of weekly chemotherapy in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In a retrospective survey of 85 patients who received chemotherapy as treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, the authors found that clinically apparent thromboembolic disorders occurred in four of 11 patients receiving weekly chemotherapy, and in none of 74 patients who were treated on less intensive schedules, suggesting that intensive weekly chemotherapy is thrombogenic. The possible mechanisms of this effect are discussed. "
cardiovascular diseases,Venous air embolism. Diagnosis by spontaneous right-sided contrast echocardiography. This report describes the definitive diagnosis of venous air-embolism by documentation of spontaneous echo contrast in the right cardiac chambers following removal of a jugular venous catheter in a patient with hepatic failure. This complication was potentiated by the presence of concurrent hepatic coagulopathy which prejudiced effective hemostasis at the central venous puncture site. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Postural hypotension: pressor effect of octreotide not mediated by norepinephrine. Orthostatic hypotension of the Shy-Drager syndrome is a chronic incapacitating condition characterized by lack of an appropriate increase in the plasma norepinephrine level in response to standing. Recently, the somatostatin analogue octreotide has been reported to induce a pressor response in patients having this syndrome. We have reported a case of Shy-Drager syndrome in which octreotide was effective, but the rise in blood pressure was not accompanied by an increase in the plasma norepinephrine level. Hence, the pressor effect of octreotide is not mediated by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, but probably through splanchnic vasoconstriction. "
cardiovascular diseases,A lethal complication of papaverine-induced priapism. A large series of patients was treated for impotence with intracorporeal injections of papaverine and phentolamine with no major complications and no deaths reported. We report on a 45-year-old black man with advanced multiple sclerosis who died after such therapy. When the first self-administered injection of phentolamine and papaverine failed to produce an adequate erection the patient injected a second dose that resulted in priapism and death of massive pulmonary embolism. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Diltiazem overdose: pharmacokinetics of diltiazem and its metabolites and effect of multiple dose charcoal therapy. We describe a 38 year-old female who ingested 900 mg of diltiazem. She experienced hypotension, bradycardia and heart block but responded well to supportive care that included normal saline infusion and vasopressors. Calcium administration was not beneficial. Serial plasma concentrations of diltiazem, N-demethyldiltiazem and desacetyldiltiazem were quantified. By comparing the elimination half-life for diltiazem with historical controls, it is concluded that multiple dose charcoal therapy was not beneficial for our patient. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Patients' observations of bioprosthetic valve failure: ""my heart is honking, doctor"". Audible cardiac murmurs are uncommon and may indicate severe native valve dysfunction. In six patients with bioprosthetic mitral valves audible honking systolic murmurs suddenly developed. Doppler echocardiography showed characteristic striated regurgitant signals. At operation each prosthesis had torn cusps. New audible murmurs and striated Doppler signals originating from mitral bioprosthetic valves are indicators of cusp tears. Recognition of this is important because early detection of prosthetic valve dysfunction may improve subsequent surgical outcome. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Longitudinal dissociation of atrioventricular accessory pathways. Unusual properties of atrioventricular (AV) accessory pathways were found during electrophysiologic investigations in four patients (three men and one woman). Anterograde longitudinal dissociation of the accessory pathway was observed in two patients and retrograde longitudinal dissociation in two others. Two patients had an accessory pathway with a slow conduction time, one in anterograde direction and one in retrograde direction. These observations further expand our knowledge of the spectrum of electrophysiologic properties of accessory AV pathways. "
cardiovascular diseases,Temporal arteritis presenting as a submandibular swelling. Temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis) is a disease of protean manifestation. A case which presented as a submandibular swelling is reported. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Monitoring the effect of CPAP on left ventricular function using continuous mixed-blood saturation. The hypothetic benefit of CPAP on cardiac performance and on a reduction in VO2 was tested in a patient before heart transplantation after acute myocardial infarction using continuous SvO2 monitoring. The CPAP added to inotropic support (enoximone plus dobutamine) and intraaortic balloon pumping dramatically increased SvO2 in relation to both an increase in cardiac output and a decrease in VO2 secondary to respiratory work reduction, validating the initial hypotheses. "
cardiovascular diseases,Coronary angioplasty requiring extraordinarily high balloon inflation pressure. Two cases are presented in which extraordinarily high balloon inflation pressures (20 and 17 atm) were required to successfully dilate a saphenous vein graft stenosis and a right coronary artery stenosis. The clinical application of high balloon inflation pressures and balloon selection is discussed. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Mitral annular calcification: significant and worth acting upon. Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is a degenerative process which commonly occurs in the elderly and has multiple etiologies. Patients with MAC have a higher prevalence of left atrial enlargement, left ventricular enlargement, atrial fibrillation, conduction defects, mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and bacterial endocarditis than those without it. In addition, patients with the disorder have a higher incidence of cardiovascular events, thromboembolic cerebrovascular events, permanent pacemaker implantation, and valve replacement. This review discusses the significance of these warning signs, explores updated diagnostic procedures for MAC, and recommends some therapeutic strategies. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Successful surgical treatment of subaortic stenosis caused by an accessory mitral valve. A 22-month-old boy with subaortic stenosis was found to have relatively mature mitral valve tissue beneath the aortic valve, associated with a hypertrophic and prominent interventricular septum. This tissue caused obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract and resulted in a pressure gradient of 70 mmHg between the aorta and the left ventricle. Surgical treatment was successfully performed to excise the tissue and part of the hypertrophic ventricular septum. Results of microscopic examination of the resected specimen are shown and discussed. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Magnetic resonance imaging--the evaluation of choice in residual shunt after congenital heart disease surgery? Accurate anatomic diagnosis presents a dilemma in patients with residual shunt after corrective surgery for congenital heart disease. We describe a patient who, after atrial septal defect repair, developed dyspnea and central cyanosis despite normal pulmonary arterial pressures and right heart chamber size. A role for early MRI is suggested. "
cardiovascular diseases,Superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm. Report of two cases. Two cases of saccular intracranial aneurysms arising from the superior hypophyseal artery take-off from the internal carotid artery are presented. The angiographic findings and technical details of the operative approach are discussed. Particular attention is focused on the use of fenestrated angled clips. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Sinus arrest induced by trivial nasal stimulation during alfentanil-nitrous oxide anaesthesia. A case is reported of bradycardia and sinus arrest induced by insertion of a nasal temperature probe. Other possible causes of bradycardia and sinus arrest under anaesthesia are reviewed briefly. Evidence for the neurological basis of a nasocardiac reflex, similar to the oculocardiac reflex, is presented. A minor, trivial stimulus may elicit this reflex. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Molecular biology in cardiology: recent developments and opportunities for clinical applications. The revolution in molecular biology that has taken place in the last decade has provided powerful research methods that are changing our understanding of cardiovascular physiology and disease. This editorial commentary will highlight several areas of current research activity within the broad and expanding field of molecular cardiology, with a special emphasis on prospects for clinical applications in cardiovascular medicine. "
cardiovascular diseases,Spontaneous cerebral embolism from descending thoracic aortic aneurysm--a case report. A case in which an aneurysm of the proximal descending thoracic aorta was the likely source of retrograde cerebral embolism is described. Atherosclerotic disease of the descending thoracic aorta should be considered as an unusual source of cerebral emboli. 
cardiovascular diseases,Transesophageal echocardiography in the diagnosis of left atrial appendage aneurysm. Intrapericardial left atrial appendage aneurysm is rare. We describe the transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic findings in a 42-year-old man with atrial arrhythmia and an abnormal left atrial appendage on chest roentgenogram. Presence of an intrapericardial left atrial appendage aneurysm was confirmed at surgery. 
cardiovascular diseases,"New technique for the arterial switch operation in difficult situations. The technique described here, a modification of the Aubert operation, avoids coronary reimplantation and also eliminates the need to use artificial material to transfer coronary circulation. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Neisseria mucosa endocarditis. A case of Neisseria mucosa tricuspid valve endocarditis in an intravenous drug abuser is described. The patient was treated initially with intravenous penicillin G followed by oral penicillin VK but relapsed. He was cured after 4 weeks of combined therapy with penicillin G and gentamicin. In vitro synergy studies performed on the patient's and two other isolates revealed synergy in all three. Thus, combination therapy is recommended for treatment of recalcitrant cases of bacterial endocarditis caused by N. mucosa. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Spinal cord injury after subclavian flap aortoplasty. An experimental study in piglets. Paraplegia is a rare but much feared complication of corrective surgery for coarctation of the aorta. The problem was studied in 31 newborn pigs submitted to subclavian flap aortoplasty. The aortic cross-clamping time ranged from 9-25 min. Twenty-three piglets with clamping times 9-18 min were neurologically intact, whereas eight with aortic clamping for 18-25 min became paraplegic. The clinical implications for newborn children with symptomatic aortic coarctation are discussed with regard to these experimental findings. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Multiple orbital tumors were cavernous hemangiomas. Two distinct masses in the left orbit were incidentally found in a 48-year-old woman during a computed tomographic scan done to evaluate neurologic complaints. Initial diagnostic considerations focused on a lymphoproliferative disorder or other systemic disease. Orbitotomy revealed two discrete tumors, both cavernous hemangiomas. Although uncommon, cavernous hemangioma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the patient with multiple orbital lesions. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Carotid-cavernous sinus fistula associated with a primitive trigeminal artery. Carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas are not rare, but they have never been reported in association with persistent primitive trigeminal artery. We recently encountered such a case. The Jaeger-Hamby procedure was employed, with mandatory occlusion of the primitive trigeminal artery. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Atrial fibrillation with cardiac tamponade as the initial manifestation of malignant pericarditis This article describes the case of a 72-year-old woman with cardiac tamponade and atrial fibrillation as the initial manifestation of a lymphoid malignancy. The pathogenesis of cardiac tamponade, various diagnostic modalities, and therapy of this condition are reviewed. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Medicinal leeches: once again at the forefront of medicine. Medical grade leeches have recently been used in the management of acute problems relative to venous congestion in patients with traumatic injuries and surgical problems. Specific cases, especially in the realm of reconstructive microsurgery, have demonstrated the effectiveness and application of leech therapy. Specific contraindications include arterial insufficiency from either anatomic or mechanical obstruction. We present five illustrative cases of successful therapeutic intervention. "
cardiovascular diseases,"A possible role for antiphospholipid antibodies in acquired cardiac valve deformity. We studied the frequency of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in patients undergoing cardiac valve replacement, and present the results in the context of the pathology of the valve lesions. Forty-eight consecutive patients undergoing valve replacement were studied. Of the whole group, 15 (31%) had antibody levels greater than 2 SD above the mean for a control group of healthy persons and 11 (23%) had a level of greater than 3 SD. There was an increased frequency of elevated antibody levels in patients with valves showing fibrocalcific change and a significant association between aPL and valve thrombus. The possible role of these antibodies in the pathogenesis of the valve lesions is discussed. "
cardiovascular diseases,Late arterial hemorrhage secondary to a Greenfield filter requiring operative intervention. Retroperitoneal hematomas associated with Greenfield filters have been described and are generally characterized as clinically insignificant. We report a retroperitoneal hematoma that was associated with a Greenfield filter and that required operative intervention because of hemodynamic instability. At operation a lumbar arterial laceration apparently caused by a protruding filter prong was identified and ligated. The implications of this occurrence for filter placement indications are discussed. The potential life-threatening severity of filter-associated hematomas is emphasized. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Anorectal varices--their frequency in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. Anorectal varices in portal hypertension have been little studied: Seventy eight per cent of 72 patients with portal hypertension had anorectal varices shown at flexible sigmoidoscopy. Significantly more patients with noncirrhotic portal hypertension had these varices than patients with cirrhosis (89% v 56%, p less than 0.01). "
cardiovascular diseases,"Acute central nervous system symptoms caused by ibuprofen in connective tissue disease. We describe 2 cases of acute encephalopathy in patients with connective tissue disease caused by small doses of ibuprofen. In addition to aseptic meningitis, both patients had altered mental status and focal neurologic signs, ophthalmoplegia in one and hemiparesis in the other. The spectrum of neurologic manifestations of ibuprofen hypersensitivity is reviewed. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Initial CT findings in 753 patients with severe head injury. A report from the NIH Traumatic Coma Data Bank. In this prospective multicenter study, the authors have examined data derived from the initial computerized tomography (CT) scans of 753 patients with severe head injury. When the CT findings were related to abnormal intracranial pressure and to death, the most important characteristics of the scans were: midline shift: compression or obliteration of the mesencephalic cisterns: and the presence of subarachnoid blood. Diffuse hemispheric swelling was also found to be associated with an early episode of either hypoxia or hypotension. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Massive histamine release in a patient with systemic mastocytosis. We have measured plasma histamine concentrations, systemic vascular resistance, cardiac output and arterial pressure during laparotomy in a patient with systemic mastocytosis. The patient developed vasodilation and hypotension during surgery, associated with a massive increase in plasma histamine concentration. "
cardiovascular diseases,"A randomized trial comparing direct current therapy and bipolar diathermy in the outpatient treatment of third-degree hemorrhoids. Fifty patients with third-degree hemorrhoids were randomized to receive outpatient treatment with either bipolar diathermy or direct current therapy. Direct current therapy was used to treat 26 patients and bipolar diathermy was used to treat 24 patients. Twenty patients in each group were successfully treated as judged by resolution of symptoms and shrinkage of hemorrhoidal tissue. Both treatments are effective in the outpatient management of large, prolapsing hemorrhoids. Bipolar diathermy is less time consuming and better tolerated. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Comparison of pulse oximeters: accuracy at low arterial pressure in volunteers. A laboratory model was developed of limb hypoperfusion in volunteers, using parital occlusion of the brachial artery with consequent reduction in radial artery pulse pressure. This was used to compare the function of 13 pulse oximeters and the effect of reduced pulse pressure and mild hypoxia on these devices. With the exception of one device, all the pulse oximeters studied demonstrated similar accuracies at pulse pressures exceeding 20 mm Hg. There were however, significant differences between several of the pulse oximeters in both ability to display readings and accuracy of readings displayed when brachial artery occlusion reduced radial artery pulse pressures equal to or less than 20 mm Hg. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Closed heart cryoablation of the His bundle using an anterior septal approach. His bundle cryosurgical ablation using a closed heart anterior septal approach was used in 6 patients. There were 3 men and 3 women, aged 24 to 73 years. Three patients had atrial fibrillation and 2 patients had atrial flutter (2 with combined episodes of atrial tachycardia). One patient had atrial tachycardia. Five patients had no structural heart disease and 1 patient had left ventricular dilatation (ejection fraction, 0.35). All patients undergoing His bundle cryosurgical ablation had permanent heart block without intraoperative complications (mean follow-up, 25 months). Closed heart anteroseptal cryoablation of the His bundle is effective and is an alternative to attempted catheter ablation. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Primary malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the aorta associated with aortic dissection. We report a unique case of primary aortic malignant fibrous histiocytoma presenting clinically as aortic dissection. To our knowledge, this occurrence is the first ever reported. The magnetic resonance imaging technique may provide superiority in the differential diagnosis between tumor and hematoma of aortic dissection. Aortic tumor, although rare, should be included among the causes of aortic dissection. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Repair of coarctation with persistent fifth arterial arch and atresia of the fourth aortic arch. Coarctation of the aorta with persistent fifth arterial arch and atresia of the fourth aortic arch between the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries was treated surgically in a two-month-old boy with transposition of the great arteries and double-outlet right ventricle. The aortic arch was repaired using side-to-side anastomosis of the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries, patch repair of the coarctated segment at the origin of the left subclavian artery, and ligation of the patent ductus arteriosus. Pulmonary arterial banding and balloon atrioseptostomy were performed for associated anomalies. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Fatal pulmonary venoocclusive disease secondary to a generalized venulopathy: a new syndrome presenting with facial swelling and pericardial tamponade. We describe a patient who developed fatal pulmonary artery hypertension secondary to diffuse venulitis. This otherwise healthy young woman first presented with generalized venulopathy, with chemosis, facial swelling, pleural effusions, and pericardial tamponade. The symptoms partially responded to steroid therapy, but over a 2-year course, a rapidly progressive and fatal venoocclusive disease developed. No other primary condition was diagnosed, and at autopsy, the patient had striking venulitis throughout, including the pulmonary bed. We believe that this is a unique case of pulmonary hypertension resulting from a generalized venulopathy. "
cardiovascular diseases,Intra-aortic balloon pump for combined myocardial contusion and thoracic aortic rupture. The coexistence of myocardial contusion and thoracic aortic injury is probably more common than recognized following rapid deceleration multisystem trauma. This report describes the successful application of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation in a critically injured patient requiring emergent repair of a thoracic aortic tear complicated by ventricular failure due to cardiac contusion. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Dialysis considerations in the elderly patient. This brief review discusses several aspects of dialytic care pertinent to the older dialysis patient. Heart disease, nutrition, and the quality of life for these patients are considered. "
cardiovascular diseases,Hemifacial spasm caused by a spontaneous dissecting aneurysm of the vertebral artery. Case report. The authors describe the first reported case of dissecting aneurysm presenting with hemifacial spasm. The patient was a 58-year-old woman with left hemifacial spasm of 2 years' duration. Cranial nerve examination was otherwise normal and no other clinical symptoms were observed. Vertebral angiography revealed a fusiform enlargement of the left vertebral artery and contrast medium remaining in the intramural false lumen in the venous phase. Microvascular decompression of the facial nerve with wrapping of the aneurysm resulted in complete relief of the hemifacial spasm. 
cardiovascular diseases,"New calcium antagonists: relevance of vasoselectivity. The calcium antagonists are a heterogeneous class of drugs used to treat a number of cardiovascular disorders. A new generation of calcium antagonists under development have a higher degree of selectivity for vascular smooth muscle and coronary vasculature compared with verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem. The clinical relevance of vasoselectivity and its impact on drug selection are discussed. The newer calcium antagonists are important alternatives to older agents and may be associated with improved tolerance and a reduced incidence of adverse effects. Their place in therapy has yet to be defined by comparative studies of efficacy and safety. "
cardiovascular diseases,Transcatheter treatment of splenic artery aneurysms (SAA). Report of two cases. Splenic artery embolization with steel coils was performed in two patients who both had large splenic artery aneurysms and hepatic cirrhosis complicated by hypersplenism. A good clinical effect was noticed after the procedure. It was concluded that this treatment is safe and effective and decreases the risk of splenic artery rupture. It also corrects hypersplenism. Transcatheter embolization appears to be a preferable alternative to surgery in such cases. 
cardiovascular diseases,"False aneurysm formation of the great arteries after arterial switch operation. An infant with simple transposition of the great arteries underwent a two-staged arterial switch operation, after which mediastinal infection occurred. Continuous irrigation with povidone-iodine solution was performed for 10 days. After that, the patient experienced life-threatening hemorrhage three times. At the time of the second hemorrhage, greater omental transfer was performed. On postoperative day 109, false aneurysm was recognized, having developed from both great arteries. Successful repair was performed on postoperative day 110. "
cardiovascular diseases,"How to select a drug for the long-term treatment of chronic heart failure. First-line drugs for the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure should produce immediate symptomatic benefit, improve exercise tolerance, and thereby improve the quality of life. They should preferentially be active as monotherapy or at least reduce the need for comedication. The drugs must be safe and well tolerated by patients and change, in the end, the natural history of the disease, so that sudden death will be prevented and life expectancy improves. None of the currently available drugs satisfies all these criteria. Diuretics, digitalis, converting-enzyme inhibitors, and ibopamine come close to the described ideal. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Severe hypotension due to intramyometrial injection of prostaglandin E2 Treatment of postpartum haemorrhage because of uterine atony with intramyometrial prostaglandin E2 1 mg, in an anaesthetised patient resulted in life-threatening hypotension. Anaesthetists should be aware of the potential cardiovascular side effects of prostaglandins. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Death at cardiac catheterization: coronary artery embolization of calcium debris from Ionescu-Shiley bioprosthesis. The case described is a death due to embolization of calcium debris from a bioprosthesis, dislodged at cardiac catheterization. As more bioprosthetic valves are implanted, and more of them fail long-term with calcification, such complications of the invasive study of these valves may be expected. "
cardiovascular diseases,"The effect of dopexamine HCl upon collateral perfusion of the acutely ischemic myocardium in anesthetized dogs. The effects of low-dose (10(-9) and 3 x 10(-9) mole/kg/min) infusions of dopexamine HCl, a new synthetic catecholamine with beta 2-adrenergic and DA1-dopaminergic agonostic actions, was tested in anesthetized dogs, with and without acute ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The infusions caused diastolic arterial blood pressure to fall by 12 +/- 4 and 23 +/- 5 mmHg, respectively. Microsphere-estimated collateral blood flow to the ischemic myocardium did not change significantly during the drug infusions. The findings suggest that low doses of dopexamine HCl do not cause coronary ""steal"" from acutely ischemic myocardium. "
cardiovascular diseases,"The natural history of thrombocytopenia associated with preeclampsia. Sixty-one of 375 women with hypertension and preeclampsia in a 48-month period had thrombocytopenia. By postpartum day 3, 90% of these women had rising platelet counts, and by day 4, 59 of 61 women had counts greater than 100,000/mm3. The two exceptions had other pathologic conditions in addition to preeclampsia. Thrombocytopenia associated with preeclampsia should resolve by postpartum day 4. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Mucoid vasculopathy of unknown etiology. A new vascular disorder with generalized deposition of abnormal amounts of acid mucopolysaccharide (AMPS) material in arteries, veins, and vasanervorum has been observed in a large number of autopsies at the author's institution. It is unlike any of the known vascular diseases and has emerged as a distinct disorder of vascular connective tissue. This has been named ""mucoid vasculopathy of unknown etiology."" This hitherto unreported entity is described here. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Pseudoaneurysm: diagnosis with color Doppler ultrasound. Increasing numbers of interventional radiologic procedures, often with large arterial catheters, have led to increasing total numbers of complications. Pseudoaneurysm is not an infrequent complication. It is often difficult to differentiate pseudoaneurysm clinically from hematoma. In the past, we have used gray scale duplex scanning to aid in this differentiation. We have recently found color Doppler scanning to allow quicker, easier, and more accurate diagnosis. Color Doppler imaging also can often demonstrate the track between the artery and the aneurysm. "
cardiovascular diseases,Right hemothorax: an unusual presentation of ruptured aortic dissection. This report presents the case of a 55-year-old male with rupture of a descending thoracic aortic dissection into the right hemithorax who successfully underwent prosthetic graft replacement of the involved segment of the aorta through left thoracotomy. 
cardiovascular diseases,Eustachian valve endocarditis. M mode and cross sectional echocardiography showed a highly mobile globular pedunculated mass(3.0 cm long with a maximum diameter of i.5 cm) attached to the eustachian valve in a heroin addict with staphylococcal endocarditis. 
cardiovascular diseases,Annulo-aortic ectasia with DeBakey type II dissecting aneurysm in Gaucher's disease. Annulo-aortic ectasia is an extremely rare complication of Gaucher's disease. We report successful surgery in a patient with Gaucher's disease complicated by annulo-aortic ectasia and aortic dissection. Cabrol's operation was accomplished without bleeding or sternal adaptation problems. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Use of a guiding catheter for contralateral femoral artery angioplasty. We describe a unique method employing a transseptal sheath as a ""guiding catheter"" that allows contralateral retrograde femoral artery access to perform balloon angioplasty of proximal superficial femoral artery lesions. This technique simplifies arterial access, provides support for crossing lesions, and allows angiographic visualization of target lesions during the procedure. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Traumatic popliteal artery pseudoaneurysms: case report and review of the literature. Traumatic pseudoaneurysms of the popliteal artery are an uncommon late complication of arterial injury. Although reviewed extensively in wartime, they occur less frequently in civilian trauma and have accordingly been less frequently studied. A case report of a traumatic popliteal artery pseudoaneurysm and review of the literature are presented. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Renovascular hypertension. Difficulties in diagnosis and treatment. Renovascular hypertension is not easily identified clinically, and most tests are not totally reliable in detecting its presence. The condition may be due to fibromuscular dysplasia or congenital anomalies in patients younger than age 30 or to atherosclerosis in patients older than 50. The goal of treatment is to lower blood pressure and improve or maintain renal function. Cure or improvement of hypertension is more likely in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia than in those with atherosclerosis. Interventional procedures include percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, surgical revascularization, and nephrectomy. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Delayed death from aortic root trauma. A 40-year-old man suffered blunt chest trauma, had a myocardial infarct 58 days later, and died unexpectedly 19 days after that. Autopsy showed partial avulsion of a small branch of the right coronary artery with thrombus extending into the right coronary sinus of Valsalva occluding the right coronary artery and causing a myocardial infarct. Death was caused by a thromboembolus arising from the aortic root thrombus and occluding the left main coronary artery. The case is unusual in that the major consequences of the aortic root trauma were delayed, and death resulted from occlusion of both coronary arteries. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Use of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of cortical blindness in pregnancy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be helpful in the assessment of eclampsia and preeclampsia with central nervous system symptomatology such as cortical blindness. We describe a rare case of complete binocular blindness postpartum with no other neurologic deficits, in which MRI abnormalities were undetected on computed tomography. The better soft-tissue discrimination of MRI may visualize important but subtle lesions which ultimately may help to explain the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism in such cases. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Progressive inflammatory lesions of the brain parenchyma in localized scleroderma of the head. A patient with localized scleroderma of the head, uveitis, and Raynaud's phenomenon presented with generalized seizures, spastic hemiparesis, and local IgG production in the cerebrospinal fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed progressive cortical and subcortical brain parenchymal lesions mainly adjacent to the cutaneous and bony lesions and probably of inflammatory origin. "
cardiovascular diseases,"A predominantly adrenaline-secreting phaeochromocytoma. A 61-year-old woman who presented with diabetes, nausea, weight loss and sweating was found to have a phaeochromocytoma secreting adrenaline, with a small amount of N-methyladrenaline. There was no significant increase in noradrenaline secretion. She was normotensive, and developed profound hypotension in response to the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine. These features are unusual in phaeochromocytoma, but similar features occurred in the very few previous reported cases of pure adrenaline-secreting phaeochromocytoma. We conclude that it is important to identify such patients, so that they should not be given alpha-adrenergic antagonist drugs. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Cardiac involvement in AIDS. Cardiac involvement in AIDS may occur at any stage of HIV disease and may manifest as congestive cardiomyopathy, potentially lethal arrhythmia, or pericardial effusion and tamponade. The heart may be affected by nearly all of the opportunistic infections and many of the malignancies associated with the syndrome. Although often clinically unobtrusive, cardiac lesions may be important in the pathogenesis of significant clinical symptoms and play an often unrecognized role in the prognosis and natural history of AIDS. "
cardiovascular diseases,"High cardiac output as a paraneoplastic syndrome. A high cardiac output (17 1 min-1) was recorded in a young man suffering from lymphoplasmatocytotic lymphoma. The evolution of the blood disease was characterized by two relapses, during which clinical signs of heart failure were prominent but resolved with efficient blood chemotherapy. The known aetiologies of high cardiac output were excluded. The complete normalization of the cardiac parameters with blood remission suggests that the high cardiac output represented an unusual paraneoplastic syndrome, the pathogenesis of which still remains unknown, although several hypotheses were tested. "
cardiovascular diseases,Hemolysis due to branch pulmonary stenosis after the arterial switch procedure. An infant with d-transposition of the great arteries underwent arterial switch operation using the modified Jatene technique. Severe bilateral branch pulmonary artery stenosis and mechanical hemolysis subsequently developed. The hemolysis resolved after surgical repair of the stenotic arteries. Probable causes are discussed. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Liver transplantation with atrioatrial anastomosis for Budd-Chiari syndrome. We report the case of a young woman with Budd-Chiari syndrome in whom mesentericoval shunt was first performed, followed by transcaval liver resection and hepatoatrial anatomosis 3 years later. Liver transplantation became necessary 5 years later because of deterioarating liver function with portal hypertension and bleeding. Successful transplantation was performed with atrioatrial anastomosis with help of cardiopulmonary bypass, simplifying considerably the technical procedure and reducing dramatically blood loss. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Ascites not due to congestive heart failure in a fetus with lupus-induced heart block. Hydrops developing in fetuses with lupus-associated heart block has usually been assumed to result from congestive heart failure. We present a case in which fetal ascites associated with complete heart block resolved promptly after administration of betamethasone and prednisone to the mother, who had anti-SSA and who developed clinical lupus erythematosus. This resolution occurred with no demonstrable change in fetal cardiac function. We conclude that an immune mechanism, rather than congestive heart failure, was responsible for the fetal ascites. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Angioplasty of occluded coronary arteries: use of thin shaft balloon over-the-wire system without pre-dilatation. A retrospective review was done on 13 consecutive patients who underwent PTCA of totally occluded coronary arteries using a recently released thin shaft balloon over-the-wire angioplasty system. Balloon size was determined by the closest fit to the arterial size and used without predilatation techniques. This technique was initially successful in 12 patients with only 2 clinically insignificant episodes of distal embolization and one probable early reclosure. Using thin shaft angioplasty systems, balloon dilatation of totally occluded coronary arteries can be done safely with a single balloon in many cases resulting in simplified procedures and economic benefits. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Interaction of citrus juices with felodipine and nifedipine Six men with borderline hypertension took felodipine 5 mg with water, grapefruit juice, or orange juice. The mean felodipine bioavailability with grapefruit juice was 284 (range 164-469)% of that with water. The dehydrofelodipine/felodipine AUC ratio was lower, diastolic blood pressure lower, and heart rate higher with grapefruit juice than with water. Vasodilatation-related side-effects were more frequent. Orange juice had no such effects. Six healthy men took nifedipine 10 mg with water or grapefruit juice; the bioavailability with grapefruit juice was 134 (108-169)% of that with water. "
cardiovascular diseases,"New operative method for distal aortopulmonary septal defect. A new technique is described for repairing distal aortopulmonary septal defect with aortic origin of the right pulmonary artery in a 26-day-old neonate. To prevent the narrowing of the proximal right pulmonary artery in the distal aortopulmonary septal defect caused by conventional intraluminal prosthetic patch reconstruction, rerouting of the right pulmonary artery using native aortic wall tissue without artificial material was performed. This method seems to be superior to the conventional method, especially during the neonatal period. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Introduction: nutritional aspects of palm oil. The production, composition, and food uses of palm oil are outlined in this introduction to a detailed appraisal of the nutritional and health implications of the use of palm oil in the food supply. The putative role of dietary fats and oils in general, and of palm oil in particular, in the etiology of coronary heart disease and cancer is critically assessed. It is concluded that the evidence available is difficult to interpret unambiguously. Some evidence to suggest that the minor components of palm oil might have useful biological effects is also discussed. "
cardiovascular diseases,"A giant renal artery aneurysm diagnosed post partum. We report a case of a 5.8 cm. right renal artery aneurysm diagnosed intact 8 weeks post partum. Rupture of a renal arterial aneurysm during pregnancy is a rare but well described catastrophic event. There are no previous reports of an intact renal artery aneurysm diagnosed either ante partum or post partum. To our knowledge, this also represents the largest reported renal artery aneurysm. The aneurysm was repaired successfully with kidney salvage and closure of the fistulous connection to the renal vein. "
cardiovascular diseases,"The effect of doxazosin on platelet aggregation in normotensive subjects and patients with hypertension: an in vitro study. An in vitro assay was used to investigate the effects of doxazosin on the platelet aggregation induced by epinephrine, collagen, and adenosine diphosphate. Platelet-rich plasma from normotensive subjects and patients with hypertension was compared. Doxazosin produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation in both groups, but significantly lower concentrations were required to inhibit platelet aggregation in plasma taken from patients with hypertension. The concentrations of doxazosin that inhibited platelet aggregation in vitro were similar to those that are used clinically to control blood pressure in patients with hypertension. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Conservative therapy for adnexal torsion. A case report. Adnexal torsion has traditionally been treated with oophorectomy because of the fear that untwisting the ovarian pedicle may result in a thrombotic embolus. Such a patient had bilateral adnexal torsion secondary to dermoid cysts. Since standard therapy, oophorectomy, was performed, the patient was surgically castrated. A review of the literature revealed no reported cases of a thrombotic embolus arising from the untwisting of twisted adnexa and supported conservation of the adnexa rather than routine extirpation, except when necrotic. "
cardiovascular diseases,"A rare case of renovascular hypertension due to iatrogenic thoracoabdominal aortic dissection. A report of successful surgical treatment in childhood. Renovascular hypertension due to iatrogenic thoracoabdominal aortic dissection in an 8-year-old girl with aortic valvular stenosis is presented. A splenorenal arterial anastomosis without splenectomy was successfully performed. This procedure is considered best suited for children with thoracoabdominal aortic dissection as the autogenous graft is expected to grow and provide long-term patency. The spleen left in situ was expected to be advantageous, from the immunological aspect, at the time of open heart surgery for aortic valvular stenosis, which was anticipated in the near future in this child. "
cardiovascular diseases,Paradoxic air embolism in the absence of an intracardiac defect. A 58-year-old man experienced paradoxic air embolism with passage of air from the systemic venous to the systemic arterial circulation with subsequent stroke and death. No intracardiac shunt was present. Pulmonary fibrosis concomitant with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension appears to have been responsible for the air traversing the pulmonary capillary bed. This unusual outcome of a complicated central venous catheterization must be borne in mind and guarded against in similar patients. 
cardiovascular diseases,Irrigation device for neuroangiographic procedures. A simple irrigation device for use in diagnostic and interventional neuroangiographic procedures is described. The device is used to flush bubbles and blood clots from catheter hubs. The authors also describe a technique in which this device can be used to prevent filling a catheter with air when a guide wire is removed. 
cardiovascular diseases,Klinefelter's syndrome with anomalous origin of left main coronary artery Klinefelter's syndrome is a rare entity. Even rarer is an anomalous origin of the Left Main Coronary Artery. For both conditions to occur in the same patient is hence exceedingly rare. Reported here is a never previously reported case of a coronary congenital anomaly in a patient with Klinefelter's syndrome together with the proper angiographic approach. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty in sickle cell anemia: a case report. Percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty was performed on a 19-year-old female who had moderate pulmonary valve stenosis with sickle cell anemia. The patient developed sickle cell crisis resulting in occipital infarction, but she made a good recovery. We describe this case and the methods of reducing the risk of sickle cell crisis. "
cardiovascular diseases,"The prophylactic use of octreotide in a patient with ovarian carcinoid and valvular heart disease. This case report describes the use of octreotide, a long-acting somatostatin analogue, in the management of a patient with an ovarian carcinoid tumour and severe cardiac valvular disease. This patient underwent laparotomy and tumour resection without complication. Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam, fentanyl, and vecuronium, and maintained with isoflurane as well as additional fentanyl and vecuronium. However, we feel that it was the use of octreotide that prevented a life-threatening crisis intraoperatively, and recommend its use in patients with carcinoid syndrome undergoing anaesthesia and surgery. "
cardiovascular diseases,Alternative technique for repair of sinus venosus atrial septal defect. A technique is described for closure of a sinus venosus atrial septal defect using a single patch held in place by sutures placed from outside the right atrium and underneath the superior vena cava. The superior vena cava does not require enlargement and potential damage to the artery to the sinoatrial node is avoided. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Scleroderma and central nervous system vasculitis. We describe a patient with scleroderma (CREST syndrome) and central nervous system vasculitis. While angiography demonstrated segmental symmetrical arterial narrowing characteristic of vasculitis, results of leptomeningeal biopsy were normal. There was no evidence of systemic vasculitis, renal failure, or malignant hypertension previously thought to be required to explain central nervous system dysfunction in patients with scleroderma. Signs and symptoms attributable to vasculitis were reversible with aggressive immunosuppressive therapy. "
cardiovascular diseases,Tricuspid valve incompetence caused by nonpenetrating thoracic trauma. Tricuspid valve incompetence from ruptured papillary muscle or chordae as a result of nonpenetrating trauma is uncommon. Blunt trauma causing partial detachment of a leaflet from the annulus is very rare. We report the case of a young adult involved in a car accident who had these findings. Operative repair with resuture of the leaflet to the annulus and annuloplasty using a Carpentier ring resulted in complete recovery. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Advances in noninvasive detection of CAD. Advances in the noninvasive detection of myocardial ischemia are increasing our ability to diagnose coronary artery disease (CAD). Tomographic (SPECT) thallium imaging provides better identification of coronary arteries with atherosclerotic narrowing. Increased lung thallium uptake and transient ischemic dilatation of the heart are additional markers of severe CAD. Late thallium imaging, as well as reinjection imaging, provides more accurate identification of myocardial ischemia. Finally, new myocardial ischemia. Finally, new myocardial imaging agents, such as technetium Tc 99m sestamibi (Cardiolite), should improve detection of CAD by noninvasive methods. "
cardiovascular diseases,Deep vein obstruction and leg swelling caused by femoral ganglion. We present a case of a rare ganglion cyst originating from the hip joint and compressing the common femoral vein producing signs and symptoms that mimicked a deep vein thrombosis. Excision of the mass promptly restored normal venous return. This condition has not been previously reported in the English-language medical literature. 
cardiovascular diseases,"Coronary artery disease in African-Americans. Contrary to opinions generally accepted in the past, CHD is very common in both African-American men and women, with incidence rates approaching those of US Caucasians. Higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cigarette smoking, and obesity all contribute to the high level of CHD in African-Americans. Additional research is needed about the interrelations and management of various risk factors for CHD in African-Americans outside of the sudden death of African-Americans outside of the hospital is urgent, and special attention should be given to accessibility and use of health services by minority populations. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Popliteal aneurysms identified by intra-arterial streptokinase: a changing pattern of presentation. Five patients presenting with chronic or subacute leg ischaemia due to thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysm are described. Only one of these aneurysms was diagnosed before intra-arterial streptokinase infusion, which successfully lysed the thrombus in all cases. One aneurysm had been symptomatic for 5 years and another for 2 years. Popliteal aneurysm may well be underdiagnosed as a cause of chronic leg ischaemia. "
cardiovascular diseases,"A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation with excellent antithrombogenicity. The authors verified the excellent antithrombogenicity of a blood-liquid interface (BLI) and introduced an oxygenator based on the principle of gas exchange across direct BLI. In a newly developed oxygenator, three layers of liquid flowed horizontally, contacting one another: O2 saturated silicone oil on the top, O2 saturated fluorcarbon at the bottom, and blood in the middle. Gas exchange was carried out across both direct BLIs. This system provided excellent antithrombogenicity as well as good gas exchange. The results indicate that this method will become a promising modality for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation. "
cardiovascular diseases,"Nonsurgical treatment of Histoplasma endocarditis involving a bioprosthetic valve. Endocardial involvement associated with disseminated histoplasmosis has been infrequently documented, especially among patients with prosthetic valves. The therapeutic approach to these patients is also not yet clearly defined. A 54-year-old man with prosthetic valve endocarditis due to histoplasmosis was successfully treated with amphotericin B. A review of the literature suggests that the optimal form of therapy is likely a combination of surgical replacement of the involved valve and high dose amphotericin B. Successful therapy with amphotericin B alone may, however, be achieved if surgery is not a viable option. "
digestive system diseases,Methotrexate therapy for persistent ectopic pregnancy after conservative laparoscopic management. Persistent ectopic pregnancy is a recognized complication of conservative laparoscopic surgery. Three such cases were treated successfully with methotrexate and citrovorum factor rescue. All three patients experienced mild lower abdominal pain for a maximum of 36 hours; no other adverse effects were noted. More experience with this therapy will be necessary before subsequent fertility rates can be determined. 
digestive system diseases,"Peritoneal blastomycosis. Blastomycosis is a systemic fungal infection caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis. Involvement of the peritoneum is unusual, with only two previously reported cases that occurred in association with disseminated disease. A single case of histopathologically proven blastomycosis involving the peritoneum is presented, as well as a short overview of previously published cases on gastrointestinal and peritoneal blastomycosis. The case is unique in that chronic peritonitis was the only manifestation of disease. The diagnosis was made by laparoscopy. "
digestive system diseases,"Hyperdynamic circulation in cirrhosis: a role for nitric oxide? Hypotension, low systemic vascular resistance, and a reduced sensitivity to vasoconstrictors are features of cirrhosis. These cardiovascular changes might be the result of increased synthesis of a vasodilator. Nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, is synthesised in and released from peripheral blood-vessels in man. Studies in animals indicate that bacterial endotoxin and cytokines induce NO synthase expression in vessel walls, with sustained NO release and consequent hypotension. Endotoxaemia is a common feature of cirrhosis; persistent induction of NO synthase may account for the associated haemodynamic changes. "
digestive system diseases,Gastrointestinal intraluminal pH in normal subjects and those with colorectal adenoma or carcinoma. Recent evidence suggests that the production of colorectal carcinogens is facilitated when the pH of the colonic contents is alkaline. It follows that the colonic intraluminal pH of patients with colorectal neoplasms should be higher than in normal subjects. Gastrointestinal pH has been measured in 30 patients with colorectal cancer and 37 patients with benign colorectal adenomas (using a pH sensitive radiotelemetry capsule). These values have been compared with those recorded in 66 normal subjects. No differences in gastrointestinal pH were found and the results did not support the hypothesis that colonic pH plays a role in the aetiology of colorectal neoplasia. 
digestive system diseases,"Adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's esophagus after total gastrectomy A 64-yr-old Japanese male who underwent a partial gastrectomy for a duodenal ulcer at the age of 21, a total resection of the remnant stomach for a stomal ulcer at age 25, and in whom Barrett's esophagus was diagnosed at age 47, was found to have a tumor at the distal esophagus and was operated on by thoracic esophagectomy. The tumor was a well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading down to the muscularis propria. The entire esophageal mucosa in the resected specimen was lined by columnar epithelium. This tumor was thought to derive from the Barrett's esophageal epithelium. "
digestive system diseases,Gastric infarction. We have described a patient with an acute condition of the abdomen who had infarction of the stomach and the small intestine due to atheromatous thrombus of celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. We believe this unusual simultaneous occurrence of gastric and small intestinal infarction is coincidental. The outcome of gastric infarction is frequently fatal. 
digestive system diseases,"The prevalence of gallstone disease in very old institutionalized persons. We present the results of a study that was undertaken at a large geriatric nursing home to assess the prevalence of gallstone disease in very old institutionalized persons. One hundred seventeen residents underwent ultrasound examination of the gallbladder. Two thirds of 82 women and half of 35 men had gallstone disease. When stratified for age, 80% of women and men over the age of 90 years were positive for the disease. In summary, the prevalence of gallstone disease in our very old nursing home population was found to be unexpectedly high. "
digestive system diseases,"Risk factors for transmission of hepatitis B virus to Gambian children [published erratum appears in Lancet 1990 Dec 22-29;336(8730):1596] Risk factors for hepatitis B virus transmission were examined in 973 Gambian children aged 6 months to 5 years. 33% had evidence of infection with hepatitis B virus and a third of these were carriers. A significant association was found between infection and tropical ulcer scars, and between e antigenaemia and the presence of bedbugs in each child's bed. There was no association between infection and traditional scarring, circumcision, or injections. Skin disease and arthropods are the two most likely modes of transmission of hepatitis B virus between children in West Africa. "
digestive system diseases,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma in a patient with surgically treated achalasia. Although squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus occurs with increased incidence in primary achalasia, esophageal adenocarcinoma has been considered rare in this condition. We report a patient with long-standing achalasia in whom adenocarcinoma of the esophagus occurred many years after Heller esophagomyotomy, presumably related to Barrett's esophagus complicating gastro-esophageal reflux disease. "
digestive system diseases,"Adenocarcinoma of the colon occurring with intussusception in an adolescent. Hydrostatic reduction of intussusception is definitive therapy in most infants with this abnormality. In the older child, adolescent, and adult, a polyp or tumor is often present. Operative intervention should be considered earlier in the clinical course both to relieve the intussusception and to define the nature of the lead point. "
digestive system diseases,"Prevention of pancreatic fistula by modified pancreaticojejunal anastomosis. A major cause of morbidity after pancreatoduodenectomy is leakage from the pancreaticojejunal anastomosis. To prevent this complication, we have employed mucosal stripping from the proximal jejunum prior to end-to-end anastomosis in 19 patients with good results. "
digestive system diseases,"Traumatic diaphragmatic hernia and intestinal obstruction due to penetrating trunk wounds. We have reported two cases of intestinal obstruction due to traumatic diaphragmatic hernia, both resulting from apparently trivial knife wounds. When TDH is due to a penetrating injury, it tends to produce symptoms of intestinal obstruction. A high index of suspicion, a chest x-ray film, and barium studies of the gastrointestinal tract are usually needed to make the diagnosis, though CT scans, ultrasonography, laparoscopy, and radionuclide scanning may also be useful. Surgeons and emergency physicians should be aware of the potential for TDH when there is a history of a penetrating wound of the chest or abdomen. "
digestive system diseases,Gastric duplication cyst communicating with the pancreatic duct: a rare cause of recurrent abdominal pain. A 41-year-old woman with recurrent attacks of postprandial abdominal pain was found on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and subsequent computed tomographic scan to have an enteric duplication within the substance of the pancreas with communication to the pancreatic duct. Celiotomy demonstrated a noncontiguous gastric duplication cyst. Internal drainage was curative. 
digestive system diseases,Gingival and cutaneous xanthomatosis associated with primary biliary cirrhosis. Report of a case. The first comprehensive case report of intraoral xanthomatosis associated with primary biliary cirrhosis is detailed. The lesions were present along the free gingival margin and labial vestibule. Crevicular fluid was noted to be tinged yellow. Generalized cutaneous eruptions were also seen. The xanthomas were attributed to the underlying hyperlipoproteinemia. Advanced progression of the hepatic disease necessitated a liver transplant. Disappearance of both oral and skin lesions were subsequently observed. 
digestive system diseases,"Abnormal liver enzyme levels. Evaluation in asymptomatic patients. Chronic elevation of serum aminotransferase levels, even in the absence of symptoms, often reflects chronic hepatitis or other significant underlying liver disease. Patients with persistently abnormal alkaline phosphatase levels may have extrahepatic biliary tract disease or a chronic cholestatic disorder. Physicians can discover unsuspected liver disease without undue risk, expense, or inconvenience to the patient by means of the following: a carefully taken history and thorough physical examination, appropriate timing of follow-up blood tests, and timely referral for percutaneous liver biopsy or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. "
digestive system diseases,"Poisoning with equine phenylbutazone in a racetrack worker. Phenylbutazone is a potent nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drug often used by veterinarians to treat racetrack animals. Its use in human beings is limited because of significant adverse effects and the availability of newer, safer drugs. We report the case of a 24-year-old man who ingested 17 g of equine phenylbutazone over a 24-hour period to treat the pain of a toothache. He developed grand mal seizures, coma, hypotension, respiratory and renal failure, and hepatic injury. Serum phenylbutazone concentration obtained approximately eight hours after presentation was 900 micrograms/mL. The patient recovered during six weeks of intensive supportive care and repeated hemodialysis. "
digestive system diseases,"Intermittent obstruction of an incarcerated hiatal hernia with a total thoracic stomach. A case of intermittent obstruction of a sliding hiatal hernia is presented. The obstruction occurred when the patient's stomach was totally above the diaphragm. The anatomy of sliding hiatal hernias is discussed, as well as the presenting signs and symptoms of obstruction in sliding hiatal hernias. "
digestive system diseases,"Omeprazole. Overview and opinion. Omeprazole, a substituted benzimidazole, is a specific inhibitor of the enzyme H+/K(+)-ATPase, which is found on the secretory surface of the parietal cell. This enzyme, the ""proton pump,"" catalyzes the final step in acid secretion. Omeprazole is a powerful inhibitor of gastric acid secretion. At the time of writing, omeprazole has been licensed in the United States for the treatment of severe grades of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as well as GERD unresponsive to treatment with currently available agents, and for the treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and other gastric hypersecretory states. Most recently, it has been recommended by the FDA advisory committee for approval as first-line therapy in duodenal ulcer disease. "
digestive system diseases,"Economic barriers to the use of oral rehydration therapy. A case report Diarrheal dehydration is a highly prevalent condition among young children and is readily prevented and treated with oral rehydration therapy. We report a death due to hypernatremic dehydration caused by rotavirus diarrhea of a 9-month-old infant whose mother attempted to purchase oral glucose-electrolyte solution in a pharmacy but was unable to afford it. While efforts such as the National ORT Project should help to promote the proper at-home treatment of this condition, we conclude that oral rehydration therapy will not be used optimally by the parents of children living in poverty until the economic barriers to its use are removed. "
digestive system diseases,"Intrapartum uterine rupture and inflammatory bowel disease. The incidence of uterine rupture in pregnant women ranges from 0% to 1.1% in large series. This case report describes a woman with a history of obstetric complications, uterine rupture, and active inflammatory bowel disease that was treated with high-dose prednisone. "
digestive system diseases,"Starch peritonitis. A case report and clinicopathologic review. A case of starch peritonitis is presented with a review of the history of this continuing problem. The syndrome's presentation, diagnosis, histopathology and treatment are discussed. The rarity of starch peritonitis today may be due to more attention to glove washing by surgeons, fewer impurities in the glove powder or lack of recognition of the syndrome. In order to prevent a resurgence of the starch peritonitis syndrome we must continue to emphasize the importance of washing gloves, maintain the quality control and purity of the powder used, and be cognizant of the signs and symptoms so that such cases may be managed nonoperatively. "
digestive system diseases,Small bowel phytobezoar mimicking presentation of Crohn's disease. A case of small bowel phytobezoar formed from unusual ingested vegetation is described. The patient presented with recurrent subacute obstruction and a right iliac fossa mass mimicking the presentation of Crohn's disease. None of the usual gastrointestinal disorders that predispose to bezoar formation were present. The phytobezoar passed spontaneously following small bowel enema and colonoscopy. It is possible that relaxation of the gut secondary to the antispasmodics administered at investigation or the physical disturbance during these procedures enabled migration through the ileocecal valve. Antispasmodics may be of use in the conservative management of bezoars obstructing otherwise normal bowel. 
digestive system diseases,"Experimental study of starch-induced intraperitoneal adhesions The effects of starch on the development of postoperative adhesions were examined in 144 Sprague Dawley rats. Groups of rats were injected intraperitoneally with suspensions of washings from starched gloves, starch-free gloves and starch-poor washed gloves, and after operative manipulation of the bowel. The incidence of adhesions was greatest (78 per cent) after laparotomy and injections of starch-rich washings and least when starch-poor (33 per cent) or starch-free glove suspensions (37 per cent) were used, confirming an advantage for washing gloves or switching to starch-free products. "
digestive system diseases,Neonatal hepatitis and extrahepatic biliary atresia associated with cytomegalovirus infection in twins. Prenatally acquired cytomegalovirus infection in twins was temporally associated with a discordant development of neonatal hepatitis and extrahepatic biliary atresia. This case presents evidence suggesting an association between perinatal cytomegalovirus infection and selected extrahepatic biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis. Congenital cytomegalovirus infections and cytomegalovirus hepatitis are also discussed. 
digestive system diseases,"Acute and chronic stress in duodenal ulcer disease. Acute and chronic life event stressors were objectively assessed in a sample of duodenal ulcer patients and community controls. Stress was assessed on two dimensions, ""personal threat"" and ""goal frustration."" Chronic stressors (those of 6 months' duration or more) involving high goal frustration were significantly and independently associated with the onset and relapse of duodenal ulcers, as were acute events of high immediate but transient personal threat. "
digestive system diseases,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. With more than 500,000 cholecystectomies performed per year, great interest has developed in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The procedure offers the patient reduced hospital stay, faster return to work, less pain, and improved cosmetic results. In September 1988, we developed a technique of performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy that we have now performed in more than 800 cases with good results. The technique allows the surgeon to fully evaluate the common duct via operative cholangiography and has allowed us to use a laparoscopic approach in all patients who were candidates for cholecystectomy. The technique offers a minimally invasive alternative to open cholecystectomy. "
digestive system diseases,"Resolution of cirrhotic glomerulonephritis following successful liver transplantation. A 38-year-old man with liver failure due to Laennec's cirrhosis developed nephrotic range proteinuria and hematuria. Renal biopsy showed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with 2+ staining for IgA and complement consistent with cirrhotic glomerulonephritis. After orthotopic liver transplantation, proteinuria and hematuria rapidly resolved. This case indicates that glomerulonephritis associated with cirrhosis may be successfully treated with hepatic transplantation. Whether the improvement in glomerular abnormalities resulted from immunosuppression therapy or from restoration of normal hepatic function is unknown. "
digestive system diseases,"Neonatal diarrhea at a maternity hospital in Rangoon Between 1981 and 1986, 1,540 infants born at the Central Women's Hospital in Rangoon were transferred to the Sick Baby Unit because of diarrhea (15.4 per 1,000 live births). Rates among cesarean infants were five times as high as those of infants born vaginally (51.0 and 10.3 per 1000 live births, respectively). One hundred eighty-four of the infants with diarrhea died (case fatality rate = 12 percent). We conclude that neonatal diarrhea is endemic in this large maternity hospital in Burma, and that control efforts should be targeted especially to cesarean and low birthweight infants. "
digestive system diseases,"Mallory-Weiss syndrome after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. We report hematemesis from Mallory-Weiss tears after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A computer search of the English language literature disclosed only 3 similar cases, and we review them. This complication of CPR may occur more frequently than recognized and should be prevented by careful technique. "
digestive system diseases,"Rectal prolapse in infants and children. Rectal prolapse that is intractable to the usual medical therapy was successfully managed without significant complications in 10 patients by simple subcutaneous encirclement of the anus with a heavy nonabsorbable suture, which was in place until the suture was removed or broke after 4 to 6 months. Four patients required two sutures and one needed a third insertion. Since this procedure is simple, has no serious complications, and controls rectal prolapse, it is recommended as the preferred initial surgical treatment of this condition. "
digestive system diseases,Endoscopic appearance and significance of functional lymphangiectasia of the duodenal mucosa. Intestinal lymphangiectasia is found in a wide variety of pathologic conditions. Functional lymphangiectasia has not been well characterized. We report 20 patients followed for 9 to 55 months (mean 30 months) after incidental detection at endoscopy of lymphangiectasia. Our study indicates that functional lymphangiectasia is not pathologic and does not warrant repeat endoscopy in the absence of other clinical indications. 
digestive system diseases,"Congenital chyloperitoneum as a cause of isolated fetal ascites. Isolated fetal ascites is an unusual prenatal finding and must be differentiated from immune and nonimmune hydrops. This entity is most commonly associated with gastrointestinal and genitourinary anomalies. Fetal chyloperitoneum, however, should be considered as a possible cause. Pulmonary hypoplasia and abdominal dystocia during attempted vaginal delivery are potential complications. We present a case of isolated fetal ascites due to congenital chyloperitoneum. "
digestive system diseases,"Chest pain in teenagers. When is it significant? Chest pain in teenagers often has no obvious organic cause. Onset of symptoms with an emotionally stressful situation may indicate psychogenic chest pain. The differential diagnosis also includes cardiac, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and respiratory disorders. Routine testing generally does not help to establish a diagnosis and may even do harm by reinforcing a patient's unspoken fear of serious illness. Most teenagers with chest pain have no such illness, and symptoms usually resolve without therapy. An important role for primary care physicians is to provide support during evaluation and follow-up. "
digestive system diseases,"Hyperplastic gastric polyps associated with persistent Helicobacter pylori infection and active gastritis. We report two cases of patients with 3-yr histories of upper gastrointestinal symptoms, hyperplastic gastric polyps, and active chronic gastritis. Biopsies retrospectively stained with Giemsa revealed the persistent presence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) in gastric biopsies of both patients throughout the 3 yr. After treatment with amoxicillin and bismuth subsalicylate, both became asymptomatic, one demonstrating disappearance and recurrence of the gastric polyps in conjunction with the HP. These cases demonstrate 3 yr of hyperplastic gastric polyps associated with HP and active gastritis. "
digestive system diseases,Recurrence of Crohn's disease after resection. Recurrent Crohn's disease develops in most patients after surgical resection if the patient is followed for sufficient time. This review examines various aspects of recurrent Crohn's disease. It is concluded that Crohn's disease is a diffuse condition of the gastrointestinal tract and that radical resection of Crohn's disease does not prevent recurrence. Assorted factors thought to be associated with recurrence are examined and the relevance of these factors to the surgeon treating Crohn's disease is discussed. 
digestive system diseases,"Bronchopulmonary involvement in ulcerative colitis. We report two cases of pulmonary involvement in ulcerative colitis. The first patient, a 37-year-old woman, had bilateral basal bronchiectasis full of mucopurulent secretion, with a marked improvement of pulmonary function and roentgenographic appearance after a conservative approach. The second patient had severe pulmonary fibrosis of autoimmune nature and died owing to a pulmonary infection. In the second patient, a sulfasalazine reaction as an etiologic factor was excluded, while in the first this possibility seemed unlikely. Therefore, we take these two cases as examples of the extraintestinal manifestations of ulcerative colitis. "
digestive system diseases,"Chilaiditi's syndrome. A diagnostic challenge. Chilaiditi's syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal and chest pain. Although interposition of the right colon is a relatively common radiologic finding, there is a distinct paucity of information in the medical literature. Chilaiditi's syndrome is usually asymptomatic, but when symptoms occur, conservative treatment is usually effective. Recognition is important because this syndrome can be mistaken for more serious abnormalities, which may lead to unnecessary surgical intervention. "
digestive system diseases,Endoscopic treatment of biliary tract strictures in sclerosing cholangitis: a larger series and recommendations for treatment. We report a group of 35 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis who had long-term follow-up after endoscopic treatment of major ductal strictures in the primary or secondary biliary ducts. Our patients were all symptomatic with ascending cholangitis or jaundice. There was significant improvement as measured by clinical parameters of hospitalization rates and laboratory data and comparable radiography. Long-term follow-up averaged 24 (+/- 2.8 months). We believe endoscopic treatment of sclerosing cholangitis should be attempted in selected symptomatic cases with major ductal strictures before liver transplantation. 
digestive system diseases,"Normeperidine-induced seizures in hereditary coproporphyria. Seizures are common in acute exacerbations of hepatic porphyria, even though the etiology is not identified in most cases. We have reported a case of normeperidine-induced seizures in a patient with hereditary coproporphyria. Although meperidine is commonly used for pain control during acute attacks in these patients, this report suggests that meperidine is not a good analgesic choice in porphyria. Normeperidine-induced seizures in patients with porphyria may be treated by withdrawal of meperidine therapy and selective use of anticonvulsants. "
digestive system diseases,"Dental enamel defects in first-degree relatives of coeliac disease patients. To find out whether dental changes can be used to screen for coeliac disease among apparently healthy relatives of patients with the disorder, 56 healthy first-degree relatives of such patients were subjected to dental examination and small bowel biopsy. 25 had coeliac-type general permanent-tooth enamel lesions. All 7 who had histological evidence of coeliac disease also had enamel lesions. The finding that enamel defects may occur without small bowel changes must be borne in mind in screening. The coeliac-type enamel changes were strongly associated with HLA-DR3, and most of the DR3 alleles belonged to the extended haplotype A1; B8; DR3 group. "
digestive system diseases,"Electrophysiology of motor pathways for sphincter control in multiple sclerosis. The central and peripheral motor pathways serving striated sphincter muscle function were studied using cortical and lumbar transcutaneous electrical stimulation, pudendal nerve stimulation and sphincter electromyography in 23 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), and sphincter disturbance, including incontinence of urine or faeces, urinary voiding dysfunction, or constipation. The central motor conduction time was significantly increased in the MS group compared to controls (p less than 0.05). Damage to both the upper and lower motor neuron pathways can contribute to sphincter disturbance in MS. The latter may be due to coexisting pathology or to involvement of the conus medullaris by MS. "
digestive system diseases,"Perforation and tumor formation of the intestine in primary amyloidosis. We report a case of primary amyloidosis with repeated bowel perforations. This patient also had localized amyloid deposition creating a tumorous region mimicking malignancy in the rectum. Perforation of the intestine is common in systemic amyloidosis. The ischemic change due to amyloid infiltration into the vessel wall may lead to perforation of the affected bowel. Amyloid tumors occur more often in localized amyloid than in systemic amyloidosis. Macroscopically, it is difficult to distinguish amyloid tumor of the intestine from neoplasia. "
digestive system diseases,Loss of duodenal folds allows diagnosis of unsuspected coeliac disease. We report three patients with coeliac disease who presented without the classic features of malabsorption and who underwent biopsy and were diagnosed only because of the endoscopic finding of the disappearance of Kerckring's folds in the descending duodenum. This sign constitutes a new and valid aid for the identification of patients with otherwise unsuspected coeliac disease. 
digestive system diseases,"Bile sampling, processing and analysis in clinical studies. Obtaining a proper bile sample for investigative purposes is of utmost importance to obtain valid results. Bile can be collected by direct aspiration of the gallbladder, by duodenal intubation or by T-tube drainage. The optimal method of collection depends on the investigative question, as well as on the resources available to the investigator. The procedures for obtaining, processing and analyzing human bile (gallbladder and hepatic) are summarized, pointing out the disadvantages and pitfalls that may occur. "
digestive system diseases,Pathogenesis of gallstones. The many developments in nonoperative methods for the treatment of gallstone disease underscore the importance of understanding the pathogenesis of these stones. Elucidation of the factors responsible for nucleation of crystals and the mechanism by which it occurs would appear to be the challenge if we are to define the cascade of events that results in gallstone formation. 
digestive system diseases,Severe thrombocytopenia after paracetamol overdose. Two patients with severe thrombocytopenia after paracetamol overdose are described. The platelet count was lowest two days after the overdose. Neither leucopenia nor anaemia occurred. 
digestive system diseases,"Modified technique of Pringle's maneuver in resection of the liver. Crushing of the hepatic parenchyma with hepatic clamps to minimize blood loss during resection of the liver leads to mechanical damage of hepatocytes. Pringle's maneuver may precipitate liver failure by hepatic warm ischemia as well. Therefore, we controlled bleeding from the surface of the resection by using light compression on the hepatic parenchyma with a band while applying a hepatic arterial clamp at the hepatic hilus. This vascular control method can be done because the portal pressure is about one-tenth of the hepatic artery pressure and provides an efficient and harmless transection of the liver. "
digestive system diseases,Oral cholecystography in contemporary gallstone imaging: a review. The introduction of nonoperative alternatives to elective cholecystectomy in the management of gallstones has resurrected use of oral cholecystography (OCG). This article reviews basic principles involved in the proper performance of OCG and interpretation of the resulting images. The role of OCG in the current management of gallstones is discussed. 
digestive system diseases,"Pemoline-associated hepatic injury. Among 100 cases of hepatic injury attributed to the administration of pemoline, 43 had sufficient accompanying information to permit analysis. All but two patients were less than 20 years old, and 80% were less than 12 years old. Males predominated the study. Injury appeared as early as 1 week or as late as greater than 1 year of taking the drug. The injury was uniformly hepatocellular as judged by the high values for aminotransferases and by death in massive necrosis in one patient. Mechanism was judged to be idiosyncratic, and the idiosyncrasy was probably metabolic rather than immunologic. "
digestive system diseases,Resolution of the adult respiratory distress syndrome following colectomy and liver transplantation. A 32-year-old woman with liver failure from end-stage cirrhosis and ulcerative colitis developed septicemia and severe ARDS. Subtotal colectomy and a successful liver transplantation resulted in complete resolution of the ARDS. 
digestive system diseases,"Acute axonal polyneuropathy associated with anti-GM1 antibodies following Campylobacter enteritis. We report 2 patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) following Campylobacter jejuni enteritis. Electrophysiologic studies indicated that the predominant process was axonal degeneration of motor nerves, and clinical recovery was poor. Serum testing by thin-layer chromatography and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that the sera from both patients contained high titers of IgG antibody against GM1 ganglioside. These cases may represent a subgroup of GBS as acute axonal polyneuropathy following C jejuni enteritis associated with anti-GM1 antibodies. "
digestive system diseases,"Reoperation versus alternatives in retained biliary calculi. Retained common bile duct stones can be treated by operation, dissolution, extraction, fragmentation, papillotomy, and reoperation. Each approach requires some expertise, and the likelihood of success of most depends on the composition and size of the stones. Good results often can be obtained nonoperatively, especially with a multidisciplinary team. Reoperation is rarely necessary. "
digestive system diseases,"Nitrite from inflammatory cells--a cancer risk factor in ulcerative colitis? Elevated levels of luminal nitrite and a lowered luminal pH were found in 77 percent of patients with acute ulcerative colitis. No luminal nitrite was found in healthy control subjects. Nitrites are a secretory product of activated macrophages and neutrophils of the lamina propria, whereas the lowered luminal pH is due to diminished bicarbonate formation by impaired colonocytes. A hypothesis is put forward that nitrites, lowered pH, and bacterial amines are conducive to formation of carcinogenic n-nitroso compounds, which reflect a cancer risk in patients with ulcerative colitis dependent on the type and extent of inflammatory cell activation as well as metabolic impairment of colonic epithelial cells. "
digestive system diseases,"Thoracic succussion splash: a new symptom and sign of achalasia. A patient with a ""thoracic succussion splash"" due to achalasia is described. She noted a splashing or sloshing sensation in her chest related to jogging and bending. On examination a splashing sound could be heard over the mid sternum and the posterior chest when the patient was rocked vigorously back and forth. "
digestive system diseases,"Successful treatment of pancreatic pseudocyst with a somatostatin analogue and catheter drainage. We report a patient with bile duct stone-induced pancreatitis who subsequently developed a large pseudocyst that became infected after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was done for extraction of the stones. Percutaneous external drainage allowed control of the infection, but failed to seal the pseudocyst. We then treated the patient with a long-acting somatostatin analogue which shrunk the cyst within a week. Patients with pancreatic pseudocyst resistant to drainage should be offered a course of somatostatin before surgery is contemplated. "
digestive system diseases,A hepatocellular carcinoma of massive arterioportal shunts without tumor stain treated with CDDP two-route chemotherapy--a case report. Massive arterioportal shunts without tumor vessels or tumor stain are sometimes encountered in advanced cases of liver cirrhosis. Massive arterioportal shunts without tumor stain that responded well to intensive chemotherapy with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II are reported. 
digestive system diseases,Hepatic portal venous gas identified by computed tomography in a patient with blunt abdominal trauma: a case report. An abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan in a middle-aged man injured in a high-speed motor vehicle accident demonstrated the presence of portal venous gas. Findings on initial peritoneal lavage were entirely negative. Exploratory celiotomy performed because of increasing abdominal pain and leukocytosis revealed gangrene of the cecum. This report illustrates the importance of the finding of portal venous gas on CT scan in patients with blunt abdominal trauma. 
digestive system diseases,"Nodular regenerative hyperplasia: a cause of ascites and hepatomegaly after chemotherapy for leukemia. Tender hepatomegaly and ascites occurred in a young woman receiving cytosine arabinoside and daunorubicin for acute myelogenous leukemia. Whereas veno-occlusive disease was suspected clinically, liver biopsy showed nodular regenerative hyperplasia with no evidence of hepatic vein abnormalities. It is postulated that nodular regenerative hyperplasia can be initiated by hepatotoxicity of chemotherapy agents used to treat leukemia and/or that these agents exacerbate clinical manifestations of this histological abnormality. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia should be added to the list of liver problems occurring in patients with leukemia. "
digestive system diseases,"Incarceration of colonoscope in an inguinal hernia. ""Pulley"" technique of removal. Because of its relative safety, colonoscopy has become an accepted diagnostic and therapeutic procedure in the evaluation of patients with colorectal disorders. Many unusual complications of colonoscopy have been described, but only anecdotal reports of hernial incarceration have been published. We present a case of a right-sided hernial incarceration of the colonoscope that would not permit reduction of the hernia nor removal of the instrument by conventional means. The mechanism of incarceration, which dictates the size of hernia at risk for incarceration, is explained. The ""pulley"" technique, which was used to remove the instrument without surgical intervention, is described. "
digestive system diseases,Perianal streptococcal cellulitis with penile involvement. Perianal streptococcal cellulitis is described occurring in a 5-year-old boy. The condition also involved the penis and presented as a possible case of sexual abuse. The correct diagnosis was established by culturing beta-haemolytic streptococci group A from the penile and perianal skin. 
digestive system diseases,"Prevention of a false diagnosis of sexually acquired reactive arthritis by synovial lymphocyte responses. Three cases are reported in which a diagnosis of sexually acquired reactive arthritis might have been made erroneously from the history, but the enteric origin of the reactive arthritis was evident from synovial lymphocyte responses. The importance of making the correct diagnosis and the avoidance of unwarranted spousal dysharmony is stressed. "
digestive system diseases,Adult hepatic fibropolycystic disease presenting as obstructive jaundice. Obstructive jaundice caused by compression of the common hepatic duct by a simple hepatic cyst in a 31 year old Europid man is reported. The jaundice and duct compression resolved after percutaneous aspiration of the cyst under ultrasound direction and the patient has been well for 12 months. 
digestive system diseases,"Blunt trauma of the abdomen in children. Abdominal trauma in children is usually due to motor vehicle accidents or falls, but child abuse is also a common cause. Injuries to the small intestine are particularly worrisome because symptoms may not appear for hours, days, or even weeks. This can cause significant difficulty for the investigator trying to determine when an injury occurred, or who may have caused it. "
digestive system diseases,"Long-term medical consequences of incest, rape, and molestation. One hundred thirty-one patients who gave a history of childhood sexual abuse were seen in a general medical practice decades after the event and were compared with a control group. The subject patients were found to be distinct for chronic depression, morbid obesity, marital instability, high utilization of medical care, and certain psychosomatic symptoms, particularly chronic gastrointestinal distress and recurrent headaches. It is clear that these remote events can underlie difficult chronic medical problems. Questions about childhood sexual abuse must become part of the practitioner's review of systems in these difficult cases, if not routinely. "
digestive system diseases,"Safe performance of difficult laparoscopic cholecystectomies. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been advocated for the treatment of uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease, but has not been widely advocated for the management of more complicated gallbladder disease such as acute cholecystitis, previous surgery, or common duct stones. During the last 9 months, 360 patients underwent laparoscopic removal of their gallbladder. A total of 138 had a complicated presentation, making surgery more difficult. This article discusses the management of these patients with acute cholecystitis, previous surgery, or common duct disease. Using the described techniques, there were no complications or mortality. Laparoscopic management of difficult gallbladder problems is safe and effective. "
digestive system diseases,"Enteroliths causing intermittent obstruction in a patient with Crohn's disease. Calcified enteroliths as a cause of intermittent small bowel obstruction is an uncommon clinical entity. The pathophysiological mechanism involves stasis of intestinal contents and has been associated with Meckel's diverticulum, tuberculosis, and regional enteritis. This case describes prophylactic operative intervention in a symptomatic patient with enteroliths as a result of Crohn's disease. "
digestive system diseases,"Cystic mesothelioma of peritoneum: occurrence in a man. We report a case of cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum in a 54-year-old man in whom cystic masses were removed twice by surgery at an interval of 2 years. The patient died of cardiac arrest shortly after the second operation for a concurrent unresectable colonic cancer. The pathogenesis of the disease is uncertain, but we consider it neoplastic of low grade malignancy. "
digestive system diseases,"Surgical presentation of Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome). Five patients with Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome) are reported whose varied presentations included acute abdominal pain, peripheral arterial aneurysms, digital gangrene and sterile pyuria and whose presenting pathology ranged from hydrops of the gallbladder to enteric pseudo-obstruction. As the complications of the disease can usually be managed without resort to surgery, which is associated with a mortality rate of up to 25 per cent, the recognition of Kawasaki disease will prevent hazardous and unnecessary laparotomy. "
digestive system diseases,"Small bowel obstruction associated with a leiomyomatous uterus. A case report and review of the literature. A 38-year-old woman developed small bowel obstruction shortly after a cholecystectomy because of a massively enlarged leiomyomatous uterus. Small bowel obstruction is a relatively rare complication from fibroid tumors and results from entrapment of the bowel between serosal pedunculated fibroids (as in this patient), adhesions to infarcted leiomyomas, or from compression of the small bowel by the large mass. Large uterine leiomyomas clearly must be considered in the etiology of intestinal obstruction. "
digestive system diseases,"Kaposi's sarcoma of the colon in a young HIV-negative woman with Crohn's disease. We report a case of isolated colonic Kaposi's sarcoma in a 36-year-old HIV-negative woman with refractory Crohn's disease of the colon and perineum following 11 months' treatment with azathioprine. The clinical features of this case are quite different from those classically described in Kaposi's sarcoma. Among the known risk factors, iatrogenic immunosuppression would appear to be the most probable. "
digestive system diseases,Bleeding from duodenal lymphangiectasia. An 8 year old girl with recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding was found to have localised duodenal lymphangiectasia by fibreoptic endoscopy. She did not show physical signs or laboratory evidence of significant enteric protein loss. A low fat diet seemed to prevent further bleeding. Duodenal lymphangiectasia may be associated with gastrointestinal bleeding in children. 
digestive system diseases,"A complex ileovaginal fistula with associated obstructive uropathy in a patient with Crohn's disease: technical considerations and review of the literature. A high index of suspicion of an ileogenital fistula should be aroused by a patient with Crohn's disease, weight loss, malnutrition, and a persistent vaginal discharge. Preoperative gastrointestinal and genitourinary evaluation should be used in an attempt to localize the fistulous origin as well as concomitant fistulae. The principles of surgical therapy include preoperative ureteral catheters, resection of the diseased bowel and fistulous segment of bowel, and interposition of healthy tissue (ie, omentum) between the bowel anastomosis and the vaginal cuff.

digestive system diseases,"Acute porphyria presenting with hyperamylasemia. An elevation of serum amylase and lipase has not been reported previously to occur with porphyria. In this report, we describe a patient who presented with the clinical and laboratory picture of pancreatitis: elevated amylase, lipase, amylase-creatinine clearance ratio, and with abdominal pain. Only after extensive evaluation, was the patient found to have porphyria. On two separate occasions, with hematin therapy, her serum amylase decreased, as did her clinical symptoms of porphyria and her urinary quantitative porphyrins. This suggests an association between elevation of the serum amylase and lipase with acute porphyria. Moreover, this association can lead to delay in establishing the diagnosis of acute porphyria. "
digestive system diseases,"Disorders of esophageal motility. Patients with esophageal motility disorders usually have dysphagia and many also have chest pain similar to angina. The diagnosis is suggested by the clinical presentation, and supporting evidence is often provided by contrast roentgenography. Esophageal manometry is usually necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Conservative therapy using pharmacologic agents is often useful as an initial trial, although many patients who continue to be symptomatic ultimately require surgical intervention. "
digestive system diseases,"Fatal embolization of intestinal contents through a duodenocaval fistula. Embolization of intestinal contents to the lung is an exceedingly rare event, which to our knowledge, has never been reported as a cause of death. Equally rare is duodenocaval fistula resulting from a penetrating duodenal peptic ulcer. We present the case of a 51-year-old man whose duodenal ulcer led to a fistulous tract with the inferior vena cava and subsequently to progressive pulmonary embolization of intestinal contents, ultimately resulting in death from respiratory failure. "
digestive system diseases,"Outpatient laparoscopic laser cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic laser cholecystectomy has been performed clinically in the United States since 1988. After refinement of the technique, the procedure was offered on an outpatient basis. Eighty-three patients underwent laparoscopic laser cholecystectomy during the study period. Thirty-seven (45%) had the procedure as an outpatient. Younger patients were more suited for the outpatient procedure and those without previous surgery were more likely to have the procedure done as an outpatient. Weight, operating time, and gallbladder pathology were similar, although patients with acute inflammation of the gallbladder were more likely to require hospitalization. The primary reason for patient admission was patient preference. "
digestive system diseases,Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: impact of prostanoids in the perioperative period. A prospective study of 10 neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and five controls to determine the importance of prostanoid concentrations perioperatively and the relation with persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is reported. In neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia postoperative concentrations of the vasoconstrictor thromboxane B2 rose significantly and were higher during episodes of PPH; this rise may provoke PPH and subsequent right to left shunting. 
digestive system diseases,"Somatostatin prevents acute pancreatitis after pancreatic duct sphincter hydrostatic balloon dilation in patients with idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether prophylactic somatostatin infusion can prevent pancreatitis after hydrostatic balloon dilation of the pancreatic duct sphincter segment in 16 patients with idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis. This study demonstrated that prophylactic administration of somatostatin before, during, and after the procedure diminished the incidence and severity of acute pancreatitis. We recommend consideration of such prophylaxis in patients undergoing this procedure. "
digestive system diseases,Chronic anal fissure. A new method of treatment by anoplasty. Chronic anal fissure is a common condition usually treated by maximal anal dilatation or lateral subcutaneous sphincterotomy. The following method is based on a common surgical principal; to widen a stenosed tube a longitudinal incision is made across the stenosed area and this is sutured transversely as in pyloroplasty. This method of anoplasty is simple and appears to have no resultant complications. Further studies are necessary before its value can be established compared to the presently accepted methods of treatment. 
digestive system diseases,"Use of plasmid profiles in the investigation of a patient with Helicobacter pylori infection and peptic ulcer disease. Plasmids may effect bacterial virulence and antibiotic resistance, and serve as epidemiologic markers. In this study, plasmid DNA profiles of serial isolates of Helicobacter pylori showed persistence of an identical strain of this organism in a patient with duodenal ulcer disease. Three control strains of H. pylori isolated from other patients contained plasmids different from each other and from that of the original patient; two of these strains had two plasmids each. These data have important implications for further study of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of H. pylori-related diseases. "
digestive system diseases,"The role of ERCP in children and adolescents. The diagnostic and therapeutic role of ERCP in 42 patients ranging from 1 to 19 years of age is discussed. ERCP provided useful additional information in 15 patients with biliary tract disease, 15 patients with pancreatic disease, and 9 patients with abdominal pain. The appropriate duct was cannulated in 95% of cases. Mild pancreatitis occurred in two patients after ERCP. Endoscopic papillotomy was successful in five patients. ERCP plays an important part in the investigation of unexplained biliary tract and pancreatic disease. It rarely demonstrates abnormal pathology in patients with otherwise unexplained abdominal pain. "
digestive system diseases,"Dyspareunia. Tracing the cause. Difficult or painful sexual intercourse is a sensitive topic for most women. The causes range from inflammation of the vulva and interstitial cystitis to marital discord. To exclude an organic disorder, a detailed pelvic examination with good lighting and magnification is in order. Dr DeWitt describes the technique for meticulous examination and discusses the diagnoses that need to be considered. "
digestive system diseases,"Coeliac disease and malignancy of the duodenum: diagnosis by endoscopy, successful treatment of the malignancy, and response to a gluten free diet. A patient presented with subtotal villous atrophy and a malignant duodenal tumour of uncertain histogenesis. He was successfully treated by resection and chemotherapy and the small bowel mucosa recovered on a gluten free diet. The tumour was diagnosed at upper gastrointestinal endoscopy when barium studies and abdominal computed tomography were normal, thus making this one of the earliest coeliac malignancies diagnosed. "
digestive system diseases,"A field study of the safety and efficacy of two candidate rotavirus vaccines in a Native American population. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a rhesus rotavirus vaccine and RIT 4237, a bovine rotavirus vaccine, in a Navajo population. Infants aged 2-5 months were randomized to receive one dose of either 10(4) pfu of the rhesus rotavirus vaccine or 10(8) pfu of the RIT 4237 vaccine or placebo. Eleven (10.2%) of 108 infants in the rhesus vaccine group, 11 (10.4%) of 106 in the RIT 4237 group, and 9 (8.4%) of 107 in the placebo group experienced rotavirus diarrhea during the follow-up period of 17 months. Thus, in this population, neither vaccine was efficacious in preventing rotavirus diarrhea. "
digestive system diseases,"Polyglucosan body disease. Adult polyglucosan disease has been described in 15 cases. All had signs of peripheral neuropathy, upper motor neuron signs, and 12 of the 15 had sphincter problems. Dementia was prominent in 8 of 15 cases. We reported 2 cases that contained these clinical features. Electrophysiological studies showed axonal neuropathy. Somatosensory evoked potentials on the second patient were abnormal. Sural nerve biopsy showed clusters of polyglucosan bodies. Although the presence of polyglucosan bodies in biopsy is nonspecific, the number as well as the clinical features are necessary to make the diagnosis. Branching enzyme activity in muscle extracts of the muscles were normal. Hence, a specific enzyme abnormality is not yet known. "
digestive system diseases,"Complete jejunoileal necrosis due to torsion of the superior mesenteric artery. We have reported a case of small-bowel volvulus in which complete jejunoileal necrosis resulted from torsion of the superior mesenteric artery. This case was unusual not only because of the extent of necrosis but also because primary small-bowel volvulus is rare in adults. Despite nearly total small-bowel resection, the patient continues to do well 6 months postoperatively. "
digestive system diseases,"Intestinal pseudoobstruction secondary to amyloidosis responsive to cisapride. A case of chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction secondary to systemic amyloidosis in a patient with multiple myeloma is described. Gastrointestinal symptoms and indices of nutrition improved markedly after commencing treatment with cisapride, which may have been responsible for relatively prolonged survival compared with similar reported cases. "
digestive system diseases,"Intestinal obstruction by distension of a Foley jejunostomy catheter. Jejunostomies can be effective in permitting postoperative nutritional support, particularly in the patient with complicated gastrointestinal disease. In the case presented, however, distension of the Foley balloon catheter, used as the jejunostomy tube, led to intestinal obstruction which was not initially detected. Following radiographic identification of the problem, removal of the air from the Foley balloon allowed the patient to complete his convalescence from surgery. The possibility of obstruction from the Foley jejunostomy catheter should be recognized as a potential problem in the postoperative period. "
digestive system diseases,"Duodenal ulcer is associated with low dietary linoleic acid intake. It has been suggested that the falling incidence and virulence of duodenal ulcer is related to increased dietary polyunsaturated essential fatty acid intake. The adipose fatty acid profile, which closely reflects dietary intake, was measured in 35 men with chronic duodenal ulcer and 35 matched control men. The mean percentage of linoleic acid in adipose tissue was significantly lower in the ulcer group (10.0 (0.7) v 12.3 (0.7)%, p less than 0.01) and this difference was found in both smokers and non-smokers. This finding suggests that the diets of duodenal ulcer patients are deficient in linoleic acid and this could be of aetiological importance. "
digestive system diseases,"Drug-induced colonic pseudo-obstruction. Report of a case. Colonic pseudo-obstruction may have many possible causes. Some of these are well described and pose no diagnostic problems. Drug-related colonic pseudo-obstruction remains underreported, but is of importance in modern society where drugs are endemically abused. This case highlights the importance of drugs in altering colonic motility and emphasizes the nonsurgical management of this condition. "
digestive system diseases,Septic Streptococcus milleri spondylodiscitis. We describe 2 patients presenting lumbar spondylitis due to Streptococcus milleri. In both cases origin was related to preexistent intestinal pathology. Surgical drainage of a collection of pus was necessary in one case. Longterm antibiotic therapy led to full recovery. Despite confused nomenclature Streptococcus milleri must be considered a serious pathogen mainly associated with purulent infection with osteoarticular affinity. 
digestive system diseases,"Hepatic cyst associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. A solitary hepatic cyst, associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, is described. To our knowledge, this association has not been previously reported. A developmental anomaly or hamartomatous nature of this lesion is suggested. Knowledge of this association may be helpful in the clinical diagnosis of this benign entity. "
digestive system diseases,"Warner-Lambert/Parke-Davis Award lecture. Pathobiology of the intestinal epithelial barrier. The major route of passive permeation across intestinal epithelia is paracellular. The intercellular tight junction lies in and serves as the rate-limiting barrier in this paracellular pathway. Once viewed as static, it is now clear that the structure and permeability of the tight junction is highly dynamic. Not only may inflammatory events (cytokines, neutrophil transmigration) reversibly effect the tight junction but this key barrier also is regulated by physiologic events such as activation of absorptive cell Na(+)-nutrient cotransporters. Such physiologic regulation of the junction is of major importance to the absorption of nutrients via parcellular solvent drag. "
digestive system diseases,"Gastroesophageal reflux and respiratory symptoms: is there an association? Proposed mechanisms and treatment. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is a dysfunction of the distal esophagus causing movement of stomach contents into the esophagus. Patients may develop heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, odynophagia, and hemorrhage. Respiratory symptoms occur in 10-60 percent of patients with GER or hiatal hernia. Although there is evidence associating pulmonary symptoms and GER, causality has not been proven. The appropriate use of antireflux therapy or surgery to treat GER may consequently alleviate respiratory symptoms. "
digestive system diseases,"Interventional radiology of the biliary tract. Transcholecystic intervention. Diagnostic and therapeutic biliary intervention by percutaneous access to the gallbladder is an important new area in interventional radiology. The anatomy of the gallbladder, biliary tree, and surrounding viscera is reviewed in this article as a preliminary to discussion of the diagnostic techniques of aspiration, cholangiography, biopsy, and the therapeutic techniques of gallbladder drainage and cholelithotomy. Recently there has been a bewildering proliferation of procedures aimed at removal, fragmentation, and dissolution of gallbladder stones. Several of these are discussed in this article. Removal of common bile duct stones by percutaneous cholecystostomy also is discussed. "
digestive system diseases,Late arterial hemorrhage secondary to a Greenfield filter requiring operative intervention. Retroperitoneal hematomas associated with Greenfield filters have been described and are generally characterized as clinically insignificant. We report a retroperitoneal hematoma that was associated with a Greenfield filter and that required operative intervention because of hemodynamic instability. At operation a lumbar arterial laceration apparently caused by a protruding filter prong was identified and ligated. The implications of this occurrence for filter placement indications are discussed. The potential life-threatening severity of filter-associated hematomas is emphasized. 
digestive system diseases,"Polyarteritis nodosa presenting as a biliary stricture. Polyarteritis nodosa, a disease of the media of small and medium-sized arteries, has protean manifestations and many presenting signs and symptoms. Gastrointestinal involvement is common but involvement of the biliary tree is rare. We report a unique case of polyarteritis presenting as a biliary stricture. "
digestive system diseases,"Pivoting larynx--an unusual clinical observation at laryngoscopy. Rigid oesophagoscopy was planned in the investigation of a young patient with dysphagia. During laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation an unusual pivoting manoeuvre was required to see the vocal cords. Although the initial diagnostic investigations were unhelpful, follow up directed at explaining the clinical observations led to an eventual diagnosis of anterior tubercles of C6, which explained the observation and accounted for the dysphagia. "
digestive system diseases,"Endocrine consequences of alcohol abuse. The recognized endocrine consequences of alcohol abuse are reviewed on an organ by organ basis. The organ systems for which the most information is available (liver, heart, brain) are presented first followed by those where the information base is less. "
digestive system diseases,"The hazards of surgical glove dusting powders. Surgical contaminants of many kinds, including glove powder, constitute a source of formation of granulomas. This is particularly well-documented in the peritoneal cavity (""starch peritonitis""), but has been documented in most anatomic sites. The production of starch-free gloves should remove this hazard, but the surgeon should remain aware that most particulate substances introduced into the body inevitably set up an inflammatory response. "
digestive system diseases,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory gastropathy: from theory to practice. The success of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in managing joint inflammation and pain has come at the cost of impressive side effects, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. This manuscript reviews the magnitude of the problem, the risk factors, and presentation of nonsteroidal gastropathy. It also presents some points in the prevention and management of the disorder. "
digestive system diseases,"Lymphoma of the gastric stump: report of a case. We report a case of primary lymphoma on a previously resected stomach in a 62-year-old man. The patient was treated 22 years earlier with a partial gastrectomy and Billroth II reconstruction for a benign gastric ulcer. The rarity of this entity and its possible relationship with pseudolymphoma or lymphoid nodular hyperplasia is discussed, and the literature is reviewed. "
digestive system diseases,Ischemic colitis in a crack abuser. We report a case of acute colitis temporally associated with smoking crack. Colonoscopy revealed a patchy left-sided hemorrhagic inflammation from the rectosigmoid colon to the splenic flexure. Biopsy specimens were consistent with resolving ischemic colitis. This entity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute bloody diarrhea in recreational drug users. 
digestive system diseases,"Oral contraception in disease states. Oral contraceptives are clearly contraindicated in patients with a history of thromboembolic disease, ischemic heart attack, or cerebral stroke. Patients requiring long-term anticoagulant treatment can be treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs to prevent ovulation, because ruptured follicles can cause massive intraperitoneal bleeding. Patients with essential hypertension and severe liver diseases should also discontinue treatment 4 weeks before major elective surgery. Migraine and diabetes mellitus are regarded as relative contraindications, depending on the individual situation. Long-term diseases, such as Crohn's disease, epilepsy, and sickle cell anemia, also require individualized consultation. "
digestive system diseases,"Malignant potential of juvenile polyposis coli. Report of a case and review of the literature. Juvenile polyps of the colon and rectum traditionally have been viewed as being benign inflammatory or harmartomatous lesions without potential for malignant change. The authors report a case of adenocarcinoma developing in a patient with sporadic juvenile polyposis. Juvenile polyposis was diagnosed in the patient at age 4 years. He underwent subtotal colectomy at age 6 years. At age 12, he underwent a proctectomy and a Swenson pull-through because of adenomatous changes in the rectal stump. At age 19 surveillance endoscopy revealed invasive cancer in a juvenile polyp. "
digestive system diseases,"Hemolytic-uremic syndrome in children. A serious hazard of undercooked beef. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome is the leading cause of acute renal failure in childhood. Its incidence in North America is increasing. Escherichia coli O157:H7 is the most common infectious trigger and is spread by contaminated beef products as well as from person to person. Antibiotics or antidiarrheal medications should not be used in the treatment of E coli hemorrhagic colitis or hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Mortality in children with the syndrome has fallen to less than 10% in North America, largely because of careful attention to nutrition, maintenance of a normal fluid and electrolyte balance, and careful monitoring. Education and emotional support of the family are important aspects of the treatment program. "
digestive system diseases,"Cecal diverticulitis presented as a cecal tumor. Seven patients diagnosed as having acute appendicitis were operated on and a cecal wall mass due to cecal diverticulitis was found. In two patients the mass could not be separated from the cecal wall and right colectomy was performed. In five patients, in whom the mass could be separated from the cecum, conservative operations (three diverticulectomies and two wedge resections) were performed, thus avoiding needless, more extensive surgery. "
digestive system diseases,"A case of severe pancytopenia caused by ibuprofen. We here present the case of a patient with severe neutropenia, haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia associated with long-term use of ibuprofen. The blood parameters rapidly normalized when the drug was discontinued, and no further treatment, except for a short course of antibiotics, was required. "
digestive system diseases,"Umbilical cord ulceration and intestinal atresia: a new association? In three fetuses, congenital intestinal atresia was associated with linear ulcerations of the umbilical cord. In two cases, hemorrhage was seen from the cord ulcer. Both fetuses required emergency cesarean section for fetal distress and were born anemic. The third fetus was mildly hydropic, attributed to hemorrhage, and was stillborn. The mechanism of the association could not be determined. These cases suggest a risk of prenatal umbilical cord hemorrhage in infants with intestinal atresia. "
digestive system diseases,Experimental reduction of portal hypertension by mechanical increase of liver portal flow Studies on the isolated perfused rat liver demonstrated that an increase in portal pressure is associated with an increase in the portal blood flow in normal and in cirrhotic livers. In two pigs with portal hypertension mesenteric portal pressure was lowered by mechanically increasing the liver portal blood flow by means of a balloon pump around the portal vein. 
digestive system diseases,"Gynecomastia. A bothersome but readily treatable problem. Although breast enlargement in boys and men can cause both psychological and physical distress, the disorder is rarely serious and is readily treatable. Several factors can lead to the estrogenic excess that causes growth of breast tissue. Dr Jacobs describes a patient with gynecomastia related to cirrhosis of the liver who responded promptly to a brief course of tamoxifen citrate therapy. "
digestive system diseases,"Intracorporeal biliary lithotripsy. Most bile duct calculi can be removed with standard percutaneous or endoscopic techniques. Very large stones are the most common cause for failure. Intracorporeal lithotripsy, and EHL in particular, can be used safely in either the biliary tree or gallbladder to fragment these large stones and allow percutaneous removal or passage. Intracorporeal EHL requires direct vision to prevent damage to the bile duct mucosa. Intracorporeal laser lithotripsy may offer some safety advantages, but the laser requires much more expensive equipment than intracorporeal EHL. Additional studies are needed to determine the technique that is better in each circumstance. "
digestive system diseases,"Pathogenesis and treatment of intra-abdominal infection. Intra-abdominal infection is considered potentially life-threatening. Such infection is frequently secondary to perforated viscera, trauma or inflammatory disease. Simple abscesses may be drained percutaneously with roentgenologic guidance; complex abscesses often require open surgical drainage. Secondary peritonitis is usually polymicrobial; broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy effective against aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, as well as gram-positive organisms, is essential. Newer antibiotics, administered either singly or in combination, have been used successfully to treat intra-abdominal infection while avoiding the toxicity of aminoglycosides. "
digestive system diseases,"Pregnancy-induced hypertension and acute fatty liver of pregnancy: atypical presentations. Severe pregnancy-induced hypertension and markedly elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase developed in a 29-year-old-woman in whom one pregnancy resulted in intrauterine death. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy developed with good fetal outcome in the next pregnancy. This case suggests that pregnancy-induced hypertension and acute fatty liver of pregnancy are part of a clinical spectrum. Moreover, classic abnormalities of liver function tests need not be present in acute fatty liver of pregnancy. "
digestive system diseases,"Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver. Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver is an extremely rare entity. Because of its unusual clinical presentation and confusing histologic picture, a diagnosis of malignancy is frequently made. Thus the surgeon is closely involved with the case and extensive procedures are not uncommon. However, this lesion is benign and will even regress spontaneously, making radical surgical procedures contraindicated. The difficulty lies in establishing an accurate diagnosis and the histologic pitfalls of this particular process. Conservative therapy can then be applied, avoiding surgical morbidity. "
digestive system diseases,"Gastric emptying in infants and children: limited utility of 1-hour measurement. Gastric emptying measurements were performed in infants and children at 1 and 2 hours after a liquid feeding. The 1-hour measurements were predictive of only 58% of the variability in the 2-hour measurements, indicating that the 1-hour measurement was not a good predictor of the 2-hour measurement. Gastric emptying measurements in children should be continued until 2 hours after feeding unless rapid emptying is observed during the 1st hour of the study. "
digestive system diseases,"Hepatocyte transplantation into the lung for treatment of acute hepatic failure in the rat. The lung was investigated as a matrix for transplanted hepatocytes in the rat model. Surgically induced fulminant hepatic failure was successfully treated by injection of 5 to 7 x 10(7) isolated hepatocytes into the pulmonary parenchyma in 86% of the animals. No animal, however, survived injection of hepatocytes into the jugular vein. It was found that liver failure is a prerequisite for the intrapulmonary survival of hepatocytes. After regeneration of the native liver, the majority of hepatocytes are cleared away within 6 months. "
digestive system diseases,"A tongue force measurement system for the assessment of oral-phase swallowing disorders. A computer-aided measuring system using a highly sensitive beam transducer has been developed to provide a quantitative, reliable measure of tongue strength. This tool has application in both the diagnosis and treatment of dysphagic patients with oral-stage dysfunction. The device is customized to comfortably adapt to each individual. Audiovisual feedback is used to enhance subject interest and motivation. The device has proven reliable in measurements of upward and side tongue thrust in six able-bodied subjects measured during five separate sessions. It has also been used with two dysphagic patients. "
digestive system diseases,"Spinal epidural abscess: an unusual complication of a duodenal ulcer. A 50-year-old man had several months of progressively worse low-back pain associated with constitutional symptoms and a history of retroperitoneal tumor and bleeding duodenal ulcer. Initial evaluation suggested a lumbar spine tumor, but myelography confirmed the presence of an epidural abscess. Further evaluation revealed a duodeno-spinal fistula at the site of the previous duodenal ulcer, which proved to be the cause of the abscess. "
digestive system diseases,"Crohn's disease of the lung Two years after developing colonic Crohn's disease, a 17 year old boy presented with focal pulmonary consolidation. A lung biopsy specimen showed areas of non-caseating epithelioid granuloma. Although some respiratory abnormalities appear to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease, granulomatous disease affecting the lung has not previously been reported in a child. "
digestive system diseases,"Cytomegalovirus colitis and wasting. Disseminated cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is associated with significant and progressive depletion of body cell mass and body fat in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In a study examining the effect of ganciclovir on wasting in AIDS patients with disseminated CMV infection, it was found that patients receiving ganciclovir had significant improvement in such variables as body cell mass, body fat, body weight, and total body energy content when compared with those not receiving ganciclovir. The repletion of body cell mass observed in AIDS patients with disseminated CMV infection who are successfully treated with ganciclovir appears to be associated with improved quality of life and prolongation of survival. "
digestive system diseases,"Nonoperative management of bile duct stones. The treatment of choice for most retained bile duct stones is by nonoperative means. If a T-tube is in place, percutaneous techniques via the T-tract are indicated. Percutaneous access via puncture of a Roux-en-Y loop is also practical. In the absence of a T-tube, retrograde endoscopic techniques should be used. Both techniques are very effective and safe. Stones in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts also can be treated nonoperatively. Endoscopic sphincterotomy has a role in the treatment of selected patients with gallstone pancreatitis, acute cholangitis, and choledocholithiasis with in situ gallbladders. In difficult cases, endoscopic and percutaneous techniques are employed in combination. "
digestive system diseases,"Adenocarcinoma of the appendiceal stump. We have reported the case of a 58-year-old woman with nonspecific abdominal complaints in whom barium enema and subsequent colonoscopy showed a 3 cm lobulated adenocarcinoma within a villous adenoma arising from the appendiceal stump. Because such appendiceal malignancies have no specific clinical signs, symptoms, or radiologic features, preoperative diagnosis is extremely difficult, and colonoscopy may be required to clarify radiologically demonstrated irregularities. "
digestive system diseases,"Skeletal scintigraphy in coeliac disease. A patient with undiagnosed, long-standing coeliac disease had multiple hot spots on skeletal scintigraphy, similar to those observed in malignant disease metastatic to the skeleton. A gluten-free diet corrected the pathological laboratory values, and a repeat skeletal scintigram 15 months after the first one was normal. It is important to identify the secondary hyperparathyroidism of coeliac disease as a cause of multiple hot spots in skeletal scintigraphy--the finding resembles malignancy, but is due to a benign, curable condition. "
digestive system diseases,"Repeat operation for failure of antireflux procedures. The majority of patients who receive modern antireflux operations obtain substantial long-term relief of their symptoms. About 10% to 15% will have persistent or recurrent problems, some severe enough to warrant reoperation for correction. With careful symptom review, barium study, endoscopy, and manometry, the mechanism of failure becomes evident, and remedial surgical treatment may proceed. The results at reoperation are not as good as those of the primary procedure, which emphasizes the need for proper diagnosis and choice of procedure and for reliable execution of technique at the initial treatment. "
digestive system diseases,Microbiological studies of the enterocolitis of Hirschsprung's disease. The results of a prospective study of 20 cases of newly diagnosed Hirschsprung's disease (nine of whom developed enterocolitis) and 10 normal controls showed no variations in the bacterial flora (including Clostridium difficile) in the stools of the groups studied. Viral studies showed that rotavirus was present in the stools of seven of the nine cases of enterocolitis during the episode. We suggest that Hirschsprung's enterocolitis may have a complex infective aetiology and that rotavirus plays a part. 
digestive system diseases,Treatment of severe acne with isotretinoin in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Four patients with inflammatory bowel disease and severe cystic acne were treated with isotretinoin. Two patients had a successful course of treatment without any gastrointestinal side-effects. One patient had two episodes of profuse rectal bleeding that were probably related to pre-existing haemorrhoids. The fourth patient had a flare-up of his Crohn's disease after starting isotretinoin. 
digestive system diseases,Aggravation of myasthenia gravis by erythromycin. Erythromycin is not currently recognized as causing clinical aggravation of myasthenia gravis. We report the case of a patient who experienced exacerbations of myasthenia gravis subsequent to each of several doses of intravenous erythromycin. We suggest that erythromycin can cause clinical worsening in patients with disease of the neuromuscular junction. 
digestive system diseases,"Further notes on Munchausen's syndrome: a case report of a change from acute abdominal to neurological type. A rare case of Munchausen's syndrome beginning in early childhood is described. The diagnosis of Munchausen's syndrome was made at the age of 29 years, after the symptoms had changed from acute abdominal to neurological complaints, with feigned loss of consciousness, first ascribed to an encephalitis. Insight into the psychopathology of this patient is given by his biography, by assessment of a psychotherapist, who had treated him some years before, and by his observed profile in some psychological tests. "
digestive system diseases,Hepatic portal venous gas: an unusual presentation of Crohn's disease. Hepatic portal venous gas is associated with numerous conditions and traditionally has been regarded as an ominous prognostic sign. There are several reports of hepatic portal venous gas occurring in patients with inflammatory bowel disease after or during the performance of colonic diagnostic studies. We report an unusual case of Crohn's disease whose initial presentation included hepatic portal venous gas. The literature of hepatic portal venous gas associated with inflammatory bowel disease is reviewed. 
digestive system diseases,"Isolated ventral pancreatitis in a patient with pancreas divisum. A previously healthy 22-yr-old woman was found to have chronic pancreatitis restricted to the ventral pancreas in association with pancreas divisum. When conservative treatment failed, sphincteroplasty of both papillae was performed with good results. This well-documented case represents a clear exception to the commonly held concept that obstruction of the dorsal duct is the essential pathogenic factor in the development of pancreatitis associated with pancreas divisum. The importance of visualizing both the dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts to direct therapy for patients with idiopathic pancreatitis is discussed. Theories of the pathogenesis of concomitant pancreatitis and pancreas divisum are reviewed. "
digestive system diseases,"Reoperation for recurrent peptic ulcer disease. The patient with recurrent peptic ulcer evidences failure of an initial operation to control the ulcer diathesis. A trial of aggressive medical therapy is warranted in elective presentations and has a moderate chance of success. Failing this, we believe that reoperation should be tailored to the patient's physiologic status and previous operation (Table 5). Nevertheless, in most cases, we believe that the second operation should be the final operation and should consist of the procedure with the lowest recurrence rates. Therefore, we believe that the assurance of an adequate antrectomy and complete vagal section is the preferred procedure for most patients with recurrent peptic ulcer. "
digestive system diseases,"Achieving pH control in the critically ill patient: the role of continuous infusion of H2-receptor antagonists. Stress-related gastric mucosal damage is a common occurrence in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Because of the significant morbidity and mortality associated with this mucosal damage, many ICU patients routinely receive prophylactic therapy, usually with histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs). Gastric acid secretion occurs in a circadian pattern, with late afternoon and evening surges. H2RAs by continuous infusion may control this uneven pattern of secretion more effectively than H2RAs given by bolus injection. More studies are needed to identify the target ICU population for prophylactic treatment. "
digestive system diseases,"Clinical experience with biliary extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Biliary lithotripsy is a new and important development in the nonsurgical management of gallbladder, cystic duct, and bile duct stones. Most patients do not require general or epidural anesthesia with newer second-generation machines. Patient selection and the use of adjuvant therapy to aid fragment clearance are important issues that are discussed. Results from different centers are compared but few long-term results are yet available, i.e., longer than 18 months. "
digestive system diseases,"Endoscopic sclerotherapy in extrahepatic portal hypertension in pregnancy. Extrahepatic portal hypertension usually occurs during childhood, but a substantial number of patients may reach adult life. There is a general agreement that pregnancy may become hazardous to these patients, and some authors even consider this condition as a contraindication to conceiving. A case of endoscopic sclerotherapy in such a patient is herein presented, and the approach to such patients is discussed. "
digestive system diseases,"Rupture of the oesophagus during cricoid pressure Rupture of the oesophagus occurred during the application of cricoid pressure at induction of anaesthesia when the patient vomited. The patient, who was bleeding from a gastric ulcer, was found to have a lower oesophageal tear which, although repaired at operation, resulted in a fatal mediastinitis. "
digestive system diseases,"Ogilvie's syndrome. Would you recognize it? Numerous conditions predispose to Ogilvie's syndrome, a process that mimics bowel obstruction. Characteristic radiographic findings of acute pseudo-obstruction include dilatation of the cecum and the remainder of the colon but not the small intestine. Treatment is individualized. Massive cecal dilatation carries the risk of cecal perforation and its attendant high mortality rate. Conservative therapies, such as nasogastric suction, gentle enemas, and use of a rectal tube, may be beneficial. Decompression by colonoscopy or other means may be necessary. "
digestive system diseases,"Parietal cell vagotomy and dilatation for peptic duodenal stricture. Gastric outlet obstruction due to peptic duodenal stricture (pyloric stenosis) was treated with parietal cell vagotomy and dilatation of the stricture in 32 patients. Follow-up is in the range of 5 years in 37.4% of the patients, while 6 to 10 years follow-up is available in 62.4% of the patients. At their last follow-up, 74.9% of the patients were in either Visick 1 or 2 clinical status. Recurrence rates have been 3.1% at 1 year, 9.3% at 5 years, and 21.8% after 6 to 10 years follow-up. There has been only one instance (3.1%) of restenosis. Two patients required reoperation because of recurrence and one of them died. "
digestive system diseases,"Possible transmission of serum hepatitis in liver surgery with the ultrasonic dissector. When the ultrasonic dissector is used during liver surgery, the possibility exists of the transmission of virus to the attending hospital personnel because of unavoidable splashing of the irrigating solution. It becomes apparent from this study that the titer of hepatitis B surface antigen in the aspirated irrigating solution is almost the same level as that in the serum. We therefore strongly recommend that eye shields should be used in hepatic surgery when the ultrasonic dissector is in use. "
digestive system diseases,"Giardiasis [published erratum appears in Prim Care 1991 Jun;18(2):following xii] Giardiasis represents a major protozoan infection for the 1990s. This article reviews this organism for the primary care physician, discussing the characteristics, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment. Prevention and patient education needs are also presented. "
digestive system diseases,"Colonoscopic fine needle aspiration cytology in the diagnosis of ileocecal tuberculosis. Two cases of ileocecal tuberculosis are presented. The diagnosis was achieved by endoscopic fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), while endoscopic biopsies and brush cytology were negative. The usefulness of endoscopic FNAC in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal tract tuberculosis is highlighted. "
digestive system diseases,"Mechanical lithotripsy of common duct stones. Over the past 8 years we have utilized various types of mechanical lithotriptors to crush common bile duct stones. The procedure was performed in 93 patients with an overall success rate of 94%. However, because many accessories were in a developmental stage, entrapment of stones was not always possible on the first attempt, and the procedure was repeated in some patients a second or third time. During the interim, while awaiting another attempt at lithotripsy, cholangitis was prevented by leaving a prosthesis in place. A variety of lithotriptor models from different manufacturers have proven effective. We recommend that endoscopists use these devices to rid the bile duct of retained stones. "
digestive system diseases,Successful control of bleeding from gastric antral vascular ectasia (watermelon stomach) by laser photocoagulation. We report a case of gastric antral vascular ectasia in a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis in whom chronic blood loss was a major problem. She required repeated blood transfusions that were complicated by reactions and still had persistent anaemia. She was treated with laser phototherapy in the form of quadrantic photocoagulation with a neodynium yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser. This greatly improved the endoscopic appearance of the gastric lesions and effectively controlled blood loss. She required no further transfusions. Bleeding recurred after 11 months which was controlled by further laser photocoagulation. 
digestive system diseases,"Managing dysphagia. Special problems in patients with neurologic disease. Swallowing is a brief but intricate process. When this process is interrupted, as in patients with neurologic disorders, problems such as aspiration and risk of malnutrition can occur. The authors of this article discuss an individualized approach to evaluation and management of neurogenic oropharyngeal dysphagia. Three cases illustrate the diversity of causes, signs and symptoms, and clinical course. "
digestive system diseases,"Jejunal-rectal fistula as a complication of postoperative radiotherapy. We present the case of a patient with an unusual, complex enteric fistula with multiple tracts and associated abscesses. The fistula was a late complication of radiotherapy, administered three years earlier, after resection for carcinoma of the sigmoid colon. Most of the small bowel was involved in the radiation-induced disease. A wide resection was performed successfully. This report reviews current literature on intra-abdominal postradiotherapy injuries, particularly intestinal fistulae. "
digestive system diseases,Possible role of leukotrienes in gastritis associated with Campylobacter pylori. This study was done to evaluate the role of leukotrienes (LTs) in gastritis associated with Campylobacter pylori. Biopsy specimens of gastric mucosa were obtained endoscopically from 18 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia for bacteriological and histological examination and extraction of LTs. There was correlation between the LTB4 level in the mucosa and the degree of gastritis evaluated histologically. The level was higher when infiltration of neutrophils in the gastric mucosa was more extensive. The LTB4 level in mucosa infected with C. pylori was higher than that in noninfected mucosa. These findings suggest that endogenous LTs may be related to the pathogenesis of gastritis associated with C. pylori. 
digestive system diseases,"Endometrioma. An intra-abdominal troublemaker. A ten-year review of intestinal and abdominal wall endometriomas is reported. Seven cases of intestinal and two cases of abdominal wall endometriomas are presented. Symptoms were varied but a majority had some gynecologic complaint. In this select group of patients, preoperative investigations did not assist in establishing the diagnosis. All patients underwent surgery and coexisting inflammatory bowel disease was present in two patients. This review suggests that endometrioma of the intestine requires a high index of suspicion for diagnosis and that danazol does not appear to be effective treatment for these patients. "
digestive system diseases,"Clinical management of the complications of HIV infection. Patients with advancing HIV infection are subject to a broad range of complications that may challenge the primary care physician. The presence of more than one complication at a time is common. Selected, common complications are discussed, including a discussion of the approach to diagnosis and management. Areas covered include pulmonary, gastrointestinal, ocular, and mucocutaneous complications, as well as lymphadenopathy, the HIV wasting syndrome, and Kaposi's sarcoma. "
digestive system diseases,"Decreasing the risk of human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis B virus infection during endoscopic surgery. The risk of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus infection is small but finite. Urological surgeons are exposed through needle punctures in open surgery and splashes during endoscopic surgery. Safety glasses are difficult to use during endoscopic surgery and they do not offer complete protection. The Steri-Shield, a facial shield designed to be fixed to the endoscope, is described. "
digestive system diseases,"Ulcerative colitis and giant cell arteritis associated with sensorineural deafness Sensorineural deafness is rarely associated with both ulcerative colitis and giant cell arteritis. A patient is described in whom acute sensorineural deafness occurred in association with episcleritis, ulcerative colitis and clinical features suggesting giant cell arteritis. "
digestive system diseases,Intussusception encephalopathy: an underrecognized cause of coma in children. Intestinal intussusception is a common cause of bowel obstruction in infancy and early childhood. Typically the presenting signs and symptoms are referable to the abdomen. On occasion the most prominent presenting feature is depressed level of consciousness. We describe 3 patients who presented with coma associated with intussusception. 
digestive system diseases,"Technical aspects of biliary extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Radiologic imaging procedures play a major role in the evaluation of the potential patient for biliary extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, both during the procedure and in follow-up evaluation. The treating physician must have a thorough knowledge of ultrasonography techniques. Lithotripsy requires continual monitoring and frequent reassessment to optimize targeting and fragmentation of the gallstones while maintaining patient comfort. "
digestive system diseases,"Typhlitis due to Balantidium coli in captive lowland gorillas. Typhlitis caused by Balantidium coli and requiring surgical resection occurred in three captive lowland gorillas over a 30-month period. Not one of the other gorillas in the colony or their keepers was ill. B. coli is distributed widely geographically and widely among mammals. Asymptomatic commensalism predominates, but invasion of the colonic mucosa can produce diarrhea and dysentery and set the stage for local or systemic spread. "
digestive system diseases,Colonoscopy during an attack of severe ulcerative colitis is a safe procedure and of great value in clinical decision making. Thirty-four patients who had severe ulcerative colitis had a colonoscopic examination during the attack. The indications were resistance to therapy and/or differential diagnostic purposes. Total colonoscopy was performed in 25 cases and less extensive examination in nine. Biopsy was taken in 22 cases. No clinically significant complications occurred. The procedure helped us to postpone immediate surgical intervention in 19 cases. Fourteen of these patients have maintenance treatment and are still well after a follow-up median time of 5 yr (6 months to 10 yr). 
digestive system diseases,"Update on the epidemiology of anorexia nervosa in a defined region of Switzerland. In this follow-up investigation, the authors studied all Swiss women in the canton of Zurich who developed anorexia nervosa between ages 12 and 25 years and who were hospitalized for the first time with this diagnosis between 1983 and 1985. Data were compared with those from an earlier study, which focused on the periods 1956-1958, 1963-1965, and 1973-1975. The incidence of anorexia nervosa did not increase significantly during 1983-1985 compared to 1973-1975, in contrast to the constant increase found between 1956 and 1975. However, the more frequent use of vomiting and abuse of laxatives in 1983-1985 may indicate an increase in cases with mixed features of anorexia nervosa and bulimia. "
digestive system diseases,"The emergence of hepatitis B as a sexually transmitted disease. In the United States, approximately 300,000 cases of hepatitis B virus infection occur annually, and heterosexual activity is one of the most commonly reported risk factors for acquiring disease. Until the number of infections transmitted through heterosexual contact can be reduced through hepatitis B vaccination, there is little chance of controlling this infection. "
digestive system diseases,"Hypergastrinemia, gastric endocrine cell hyperplasia, and intractable diarrhea. A patient with pernicious anemia developed severe intractable diarrhea night and day. Investigation revealed chronic atrophic gastritis and a markedly elevated level of serum gastrin. No obvious explantation for the diarrhea was found, but after antrectomy, the gastrin level returned to normal and the diarrhea subsided. Possible mechanisms for an association between diarrhea and hypergastrinemia include colonic hypermotility secondary to release of acetylcholine and inhibition of fluid and electrolyte reabsorption within the small bowel. "
digestive system diseases,"Use of H2-receptor antagonists in children. H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) have evolved into the mainstay of anti-acid therapy for pediatric patients, replacing antacids and other modes of therapy. Much of the experience and data used for therapeutic decisions in children, however, have been extrapolated from adult studies. Ranitidine and cimetidine have been studied most extensively in the adult and pediatric populations. Both raise gastric pH and achieve other therapeutic endpoints; however, cimetidine appears to have a greater frequency of both adversed effects and drug interactions. H2RAs are the preferred agents for prevention of stress ulcers, ulcer disease, and reflux esophagitis in the pediatric population. "
digestive system diseases,"Antibodies in anti-HBe-positive patient sera bind to an HBe protein expressed on the cell surface of human hepatoma cells: implications for virus clearance. The relevance of the recently described membrane-bound form of the HBe protein for the antiviral immune response was examined. The data show that antibodies in anti-HBe, but not in anti-HBc-positive human sera efficiently bind to the membrane expressed HBe. No evidence was obtained that the HBc can reach the cell surface in a form that can be detected with human antibodies. The findings suggest that the decline of virus titer that is usually observed after seroconversion from HBe to anti-HBe might be the result of an antibody-mediated elimination of infected cells. "
digestive system diseases,Bronchobiliary fistula detected by cholescintigraphy. We present a case of a bronchobiliary fistula initially detected by hepatobiliary scintigraphy. The patient developed bilioptysis 18 mo after undergoing a right hepatic lobectomy and resection of the common bile duct for cholangiocarcinoma. The procedure was complicated by the development of a subphrenic abscess that required percutaneous biliary drainage. 
digestive system diseases,Endometrioma of the liver. Hepatic endometriosis is extremely rare. We describe a patient sent to us with epigastric pain as the only symptom and who was found to have associated endometrioma of the liver and left ovary. We suggest a gynecologic evaluation before surgery for hepatic cyst of unknown cause. 
digestive system diseases,"Peptic ulcer disease. How to treat it now. Options for treatment of peptic ulcer disease are becoming more diverse. Most new agents are effective yet offer no real advantage over more traditional therapy. However, omeprazole (Prilosec) may be of benefit owing to its potent inhibition of acid secretion, but it is not yet approved for this purpose. Whether treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection will prove beneficial is not yet known, but the answer should be forthcoming. Finally, as with any disease process, alleviation of risk factors is always important. Appropriate counseling regarding use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cigarette smoking is a necessity. "
digestive system diseases,"Celiac disease, brain atrophy, and dementia. We report 5 patients who developed dementia before age 60 and were subsequently found to have celiac disease (CD). Intellectual deterioration ranged from moderate to severe, and diffuse cerebral or cerebellar atrophy was found on brain CT. Diagnosis of CD was confirmed by findings of subtotal villous atrophy in jejunal biopsy specimens and positive serum reticulin and gliadin antibodies. Conspicuously, gastrointestinal symptoms were mild. The gluten-free diet failed to improve the neurologic disability except in 1 patient. CD is a multisystem disorder and may play a role in some cases of presenile dementia. Although the pathogenetic mechanisms are obscure, immunologic mechanisms are implicated. "
digestive system diseases,Cholangiocarcinoma in association with multiple biliary microhamartomas. The rarity of cholangiocarcinoma occurring in von Meyenburg complexes is well appreciated. We describe the case of a 35-year-old man found to have cholangiocarcinoma in association with multiple biliary microhamartomas of the liver. Areas of ductal proliferation and atypia within the bile duct hamartomas suggest malignant transformation to cholangiocarcinoma. 
digestive system diseases,"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis due to Salmonella enteritidis in cirrhotic ascites. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis due to Salmonella is uncommon. We report three patients with ascites infected by Salmonella. All three patients had advanced chronic liver disease, typically cirrhosis with portal hypertension. Salmonella enteritidis grew in the ascite fluid culture of the three patients. There was no clinical or microbiological evidence of Salmonella infection other than in the ascitic fluid. One patient died before antibiotic treatment was started, but the other two were treated with different combinations of antimicrobial drugs. One of them died on the fourteenth day of hospitalization, and the other survived. "
digestive system diseases,"Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced colonic strictures: a case report. Adverse effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs can occur throughout the whole gastrointestinal tract. Recently, several cases of ""diaphragmlike"" thin ileal strictures have been reported. These strictures seem to result from nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced inflammatory changes and apparently represent a newly recognized nosological entity. The case of a 61-year-old man who gradually developed similar inflammatory changes in the ascending colon during prolonged intake of a slow-release form of diclofenac is presented, and the literature on nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced intestinal strictures is briefly reviewed. "
digestive system diseases,"Antibiotic use among children in an urban Brazilian slum: a risk factor for diarrhea? [published erratum appears in Am J Public Health 1991 Apr;81(4):417] Among a cohort of children in a poor urban setting in Brazil, the relative risk for the occurrence of a new episode of diarrhea in the two weeks following antibiotic use vs all other weeks was 1.44 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.33, 2.45). Among children ever [corrected] exposed to antibiotics, the odds ratio was 1.34 (95% CI = 0.84, 2.16) after stratifying by individual child and controlling for previous diarrhea. Further research is needed to confirm whether antibiotics are a risk factor for diarrhea in such settings. "
digestive system diseases,"Chylous ascites should suggest constrictive pericarditis even in a patient with cirrhosis. Chylous ascites, a milky, high triglyceride fluid is usually found in patients with lymphatic obstruction from malignancy. We describe a patient with cirrhosis who developed constrictive pericarditis and chylous ascites. Long-standing portal hypertension compounded by elevated central venous pressure provided several pathophysiologic contributions to the formation of the chylous ascites. Chylous ascites even in a cirrhotic requires prompt assessment for conditions leading to elevated central venous pressure. "
digestive system diseases,"Cimetidine suppresses chemically induced experimental hepatic porphyria. The ability of cimetidine to reduce the activity of hepatic aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALA-S) was examined in allylisopropyl acetamide (AIA) treated porphyric adult rats. A dose of 20 mg cimetidine/100 gm body weight resulted in a 50% decrease in the AIA-induced hepatic ALA-S activity compared to rats treated with AIA alone. Heme oxygenase activity was decreased 25% compared to rats treated with AIA alone. The effects of AIA and cimetidine on cytochrome P-450 were not additive, suggesting competition for a common site of interaction. The results suggest that cimetidine may prove to be useful in treating porphyria in humans. "
digestive system diseases,Severe hemorrhagic radiation proctitis advancing to gradual cessation with hyperbaric oxygen. We report a case of a male patient suffering from a severe hemorrhagic radiation proctitis which gradually ceased with hyperbaric oxygen. We discuss the mechanisms of chronic radiation injury and the effect of the hyperbaric oxygen. This therapy is proposed as an alternative to surgical intervention for this abnormality. 
digestive system diseases,"Nausea, vomiting, and retching. Although nausea, vomiting, and retching have plagued mankind since antiquity, limited attention has been given to the three symptoms as separate entities. Although knowledge of symptom occurrence is essential to practice, nurses must focus on patients' response or distress to the occurrence of symptoms. The differentiation of symptom occurrence and symptom distress of nausea, vomiting, and retching is critical to the management and self-care demands of patients and the enhancement of their quality of life. Basic research on patterns of these individual symptoms and their components promises to provide a more progressive and fruitful approach to the patient response to these symptoms. "
digestive system diseases,"Cyclic pelvic pain. Cyclic pelvic pain is a common gynecologic problem caused by relatively few diseases, which usually can be diagnosed and remedied quickly. Some complaints reflect normal physiologic aspects of the menstrual cycle (mittelschmerz, menstrual awareness). Premenstrual syndrome can be diagnosed, but an effective and convenient treatment is lacking. Dysmenorrhea is the commonest source of cyclic pain, diagnosed by its characteristic history and rapid relief on administration of antiprostaglandin agents. Endometriosis is diagnosed surgically and best treated either surgically then, or medically by danazol or GnRH agonists. In contrast, adenomyosis is a problem commonly encountered in later life, and hysterectomy is usually needed for both definitive diagnosis and treatment. "
digestive system diseases,"The management of pseudomyxoma peritonei. The management of nine patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei was reviewed. Aggressive surgical resection of tumor is the standard of treatment, with many patients requiring multiple laparotomies. Chemotherapy, including the use of cisplatin is not effective. Long-term nutritional support provides a better quality of survival for select patients. "
digestive system diseases,"Sudden death due to delayed rupture of hepatic subcapsular hematoma following blunt abdominal trauma. Blunt abdominal trauma can cause sudden, unexpected death due to injuries to internal organs. Rupture of a hepatic subcapsular hematoma is a relatively rare cause of sudden death following minor blunt abdominal trauma. Death may be delayed several days to weeks. The autopsy is an invaluable diagnostic tool that can be utilized to uncover sudden deaths due to abdominal trauma. The case of an alcoholic who died of a ruptured hepatic subcapsular hematoma is presented. The death investigation revealed that the victim had sustained blunt abdominal trauma during a fall a few days prior to death. "
digestive system diseases,"Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome with splenosis. A case report. This is the first reported case of simultaneously occurring pelvic splenosis and Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome. No other congenital or anatomic abnormalities were observed in the patient, and she had no history of abdominal trauma or surgery. Endometriosis was suspected initially during laparoscopy for pelvic pain. After tissue removal at laparotomy, the histologic evaluation established the diagnosis of splenosis. Biopsy at laparoscopy should be considered to confirm the diagnosis in the presence of a congenital anomaly and lesions suspected of being endometriotic. "
digestive system diseases,"Six physicians with inflammatory bowel disease. This essay tells the stories of six physicians with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to emphasize how important denial and control become when a physician is a patient. Guilt at the supposed psychosomatic ""origin"" of IBD suggests that we as physicians should never blame our patients for getting sick. "
digestive system diseases,"Perforated duodenal ulcer: an unusual complication of gastroenteritis. A 7 year old boy was admitted to hospital with gastroenteritis, which was complicated by an acute perforated duodenal ulcer. After oversewing of the perforation he made an uncomplicated recovery. Peptic ulceration is under-diagnosed in childhood and this leads to delay in diagnosis and appropriate management. Ulceration is associated with severe illness and viral infections, but perforation is rare. "
digestive system diseases,"Two cases of adult T-cell leukemia associated with acute pancreatitis due to hypercalcemia. We report two cases of adult T-cell leukemia associated with acute pancreatitis and hypercalcemia. After sudden onset of epigastralgia, acute pancreatitis and hypercalcemia were found in both patients. There were no diseases that could explain the acute pancreatitis except for hypercalcemia probably due to adult T-cell leukemia. Thus we considered that hypercalcemia due to adult T-cell leukemia had led to acute pancreatitis. This is the first report of such a complication in adult T-cell leukemia. "
digestive system diseases,Squamous carcinoma in the liver. Squamous carcinoma of the liver has only rarely been reported. We present a case which highlights not only the difficulties in diagnosis but also how it can closely mimic sclerosing cholangitis. 
digestive system diseases,"Contributions of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The salient contributions of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome have made it unique. No pancreatic endocrine tumor described before (insulinoma) or subsequently (glucagonoma, somatostatinoma, vipoma, pancreatic-polypeptidoma) has been the topic of such a variety of studies, or has been such an inspiration and rich source of new ideas for investigation and ultimate improvement in patient care. "
digestive system diseases,"Pancreatic pseudocysts. When to drain, when to wait. Acute pain in the upper abdomen in a patient recovering from pancreatitis or abdominal trauma may herald a pancreatic pseudocyst. Although small cysts resolve spontaneously, those larger than 6 cm across usually require treatment to prevent such complications as rupture into adjacent structures and infection. The authors describe operative and nonoperative treatment methods and the success reported with each. "
digestive system diseases,"The acutely affected abdomen in paraplegic spinal cord injury patients. The records of 145 paraplegic or quadriplegic patients were reviewed to identify those factors useful in the correct diagnosis of the acute abdomen in this population. Twenty-one patients had 22 episodes of acute or subacute abdominal problems. Presenting complaints, physical findings, and laboratory results were useful in various ways. However appropriate radiographic studies led to the correct diagnosis in 77% of patients. Although paraplegic and quadriplegic patients are predisposed to a distinct constellation of medical problems, including urinary tract infection and calculi, they also may present with other abdominal conditions that cause significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognized. "
digestive system diseases,"Gastro-oesophageal reflux during elective laparoscopy. An oesophageal pH electrode was used to record gastro-oesophageal reflux in 73 women who had elective laparoscopy for various gynaecological procedures. No refluxes were recorded during the 63 procedures from which results could be analysed; the upper 95% confidence limit from this observation is 3 in 63 (4.8%). Two of the excluded women refluxed during episodes of hiccough that occurred shortly after induction of anaesthesia. Tracheal intubation may be required during laparoscopy, although the need to protect against the possibility of aspiration of gastric contents may not be a valid reason unless, with the same logic, it is suggested that all patients who hiccough should be intubated. "
digestive system diseases,"Yersinia enterocolitica abscess of the transverse colon. Report of a case. Yersinia enterocolitica abscess of the bowel is a rare entity. Only five cases have previously been reported--none in the surgical literature. A unique presentation for Yersinia infection, abscess of the transverse colon, is described, and the literature of Y. enterocolitica intestinal perforation and abscess is reviewed. "
digestive system diseases,"Genital and anal conditions confused with child sexual abuse trauma. Examination of a child with genital or anal disease may give rise to suspicion of sexual abuse. Dermatologic, traumatic, infectious, and congenital disorders may be confused with sexual abuse. Seven children referred to us are representative of such confusion. "
digestive system diseases,The Indian experience with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. A study of 58 consecutive Indian infants operated for congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis revealed an accentuated male predominance in the incidence of the disease and far less preoperative hemetemesis as compared to that in their Western counterparts. 'Pyloric tumor' was palpable in 89% of cases. Only 34.5% of these infants were first born. Postoperative vomiting occurred in 13.8% of patients and wound sepsis was not encountered. Air contrast radiography confirmed the diagnosis in clinically doubtful cases. 
digestive system diseases,"Pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is a common but rather poorly understood entity most often associated with alcohol abuse or biliary tract disease. Despite the availability of a variety of diagnostic tests and imaging techniques, the diagnosis of pancreatitis continues to be primarily a clinical one. Of major concern to the emergency physician is distinguishing pancreatitis from other, potentially lethal, causes of abdominal pain, and identifying those patients with severe pancreatitis who are at risk for a complicated course secondary to the remote systemic effects of the disease. "
digestive system diseases,"Treatment of obstructive pneumatosis coli with endoscopic sclerotherapy: report of a case. The case of an 86-year-old man with cardiac and pulmonary failure, in whom pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis caused segmental obstruction of the sigmoid colon is described. The patient was treated with endoscopic puncture and sclerotherapy of the cyst walls in four sessions, giving endoscopic and radiologic regress of the lesions and symptomatic relief. "
digestive system diseases,"Microsurgical epididymovasostomy by tubule intussusception: a new technique in rat model. This experimental study on 15 adult male rats with bilateral epididymovasostomies evaluates a new technique of tubule intussusception as an improved form of end-to-end anastomosis. This paper describes in detail the steps in this technique and offers physiological, anatomical, and histological follow-up after 3 months. With this technique there is a 97% patency rate and a 23.3% incidence of macroscopic spermatic granuloma. Complications are discussed in detail. "
digestive system diseases,Gastroesophageal reflux in infants. Clinically significant gastroesophageal reflux occurs in one in 500 infants. Symptoms resolve in 60 to 80 percent of infants by 18 months of age. Thickened formula and position changes are often recommended. Medication and surgical intervention may be needed in refractory cases. 
digestive system diseases,"Late volume changes in retrosternal colon bypass. Esophageal obstruction by malignancy, chemical burns, or other less common entities presents a challenge for the surgeon. Either for esophageal substitution after esophageal resection or as a bypass for the obstructed esophagus, colon interposition is often the best available option. Massive colonic enlargement requiring resection of the interposed dilated colon developed recently in 2 of our patients who had a colon bypass 22 and 10 years earlier, respectively. "
digestive system diseases,"Esophageal candidiasis in AIDS. Successful therapy with clotrimazole vaginal tablets taken by mouth. In this paper we describe the results of oral therapy of esophageal candidiasis with clotrimazole vaginal tablets in 25 homosexual men with AIDS, of whom 19 had oral candidiasis and 16 had esophageal symptoms. Therapy with clotrimazole vaginal tablets, 100 mg, taken by mouth cleared the esophageal symptoms, oral candidiasis, and esophageal lesions completely in all 25 men. Clotrimazole vaginal tablets are a useful alternative to other antifungal agents for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis in AIDS patients. "
digestive system diseases,Management of an extensive tracheoesophageal fistula by cervical esophageal exclusion. Giant tracheoesophageal fistulae occurring in ventilator-dependent patients usually result in significant ventilatory embarrassment. Cervical exclusion of the fistula can safely control the fistula and quickly restore adequate ventilation to these critically ill patients. 
digestive system diseases,"Group B streptococcus: an unusual cause of severe peritonitis in young children treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Peritonitis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients is only rarely caused by beta-hemolytical streptococci species. We describe two young children, aged 15 months and 5 years, respectively, who presented an unusually severe course of peritonitis due to group B beta-hemolytical streptococci. This course of the disease showed a strong similarity with neonatal streptococcal septicemia. In neonates, IgG2 deficiency is thought to be partly responsible for the severity of this condition. This may also be true for young children treated with CAPD, since IgG2 deficiency has been established for children. "
digestive system diseases,"Surgical management of bile duct stones. The biliary surgeon in the 1990s must be familiar with all of the available techniques for the treatment of bile duct stones. Experience and judgment are important in the successful management of the individual patient with intrahepatic or extrahepatic stones. Knowledge of the nonsurgical methods of stone removal is important in the decision-making process. However, the biliary surgeon must resist the temptation to do less than a thorough removal of all stones at the operation lest the patient be subjected to additional procedures, which carry their own risks of morbidity and death. The goal should be to clear the stones from the biliary system with the fewest procedures offering the lowest morbidity and mortality risks to the patient. "
digestive system diseases,Effects of aging on the swallowing mechanism. Normal swallow involves a number of closely coordinated neuromuscular events. Investigators have identified some small temporal changes in the swallow of older adults as compared with young adults. Further research is needed to define completely the primary effects of aging on deglutition. Many medical conditions that commonly affect the elderly can cause dysphagia. These are discussed in terms of their effects on swallow physiology. Diagnosis and treatment of dysphagia in the elderly should be pursued as aggressively as in the younger adult. 
digestive system diseases,"Congenital duodenal diaphragm: conversion of stable chronic symptoms to subacute gastric outlet obstruction by penetrating foreign body. Congenital duodenal diaphragms (CDD) are rare lesions that usually become symptomatic and require surgery in childhood. We report a patient, who, although symptomatic since early childhood, had accommodated to the condition and finally required surgical correction in late life after an ingested foreign body traumatized the diaphragm, producing subacute gastric outlet obstruction. The condition, including the reconstruction of the precipitating event, was diagnosed endoscopically prior to surgery. "
digestive system diseases,Combined radiologic and retrograde endoscopic and biliary interventions. Methods of treating complex biliary duct problems by a team composed of an endoscopist and interventional radiologist are described. These procedures are of two types: Those in which all manipulations are performed through the endoscope and those in which an antegrade transhepatic and a retrograde endoscopic approach are combined. 
digestive system diseases,A case of lisinopril-induced lithium toxicity We describe a patient who developed lithium toxicity when lisinopril was substituted for clonidine. Possible mechanisms of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced lithium toxicity are discussed. Aggressive serum lithium concentration monitoring and a reduction in the dose of lithium is advised when using ACE inhibitors because of disturbances and shifts in fluid and electrolyte balance. 
digestive system diseases,"Towards a true prevalence of peptic ulcer: the Sorreisa gastrointestinal disorder study. This study, designed to overcome methodological problems inherent in earlier prevalence studies of peptic ulcer, was carried out in a municipality in northern Norway. It included the total population of 2027, aged 20-69 years, and comprised a questionnaire and search for previously diagnosed peptic ulcers in the local medical records for all subjects, and additional endoscopy of all subjects with dyspepsia and their matched healthy controls (n = 619). The overall prevalence was 10.5% in men and 9.5% in women, a sex ratio close to one and a higher duodenal:gastric ratio than previously reported from this region. A substantial 1% prevalence of asymptomatic ulcers was also observed. "
digestive system diseases,"Crohn's disease: what about the pancreas? [editorial] Crohn's disease (CD) is now accepted as a systemic illness. The importance of extraintestinal manifestations is underlined by the fact that such ""complications"" can be more prominent and even more difficult to control than the intestinal disease itself. Lately, evidence for a more than accidental association of pancreatitis and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency with CD is growing. This might have a significant impact on the treatment of abdominal pain and diarrhea in CD, symptoms which have so far been attributed exclusively to the intestinal rather than the extraintestinal manifestations of the disease. "
digestive system diseases,"Carcinoma of the gallbladder. Gallbladder cancer remains difficult to diagnose preoperatively. However, recent work suggests that ultrasound may be effective. Gallbladder cancer remains highly lethal despite aggressive therapy. Extension of the disease beyond the mucosa predicts a poor chance of long-term survival. "
digestive system diseases,"Barium meals in the elderly--a quality reassurance. The consecutive double contrast barium meal examinations of 100 elderly patients (aged over 65 years) and a group of 33 younger adult patients were analysed by two observers for technical quality and pathological abnormalities. Technical quality declined with patient age, especially in those over 75 years, but was sufficient to enable diagnosis of abnormalities in 60% of the elderly group. It is concluded that, in the majority of elderly patients, the technical quality of double contrast barium meal examinations is sufficiently high to offer considerable diagnostic utility. "
digestive system diseases,"Chylous ascites due to sarcoidosis. A 33-yr-old black female with systemic sarcoidosis developed chylous ascites. A CT scan showed extensive mesenteric lymphadenopathy. At laparotomy, the mesenteric and para-aortic lymph nodes were enlarged and diffusely matted. Histologically, normal lymph node morphology was virtually replaced with noncaseating granulomas. Corticosteroids and dietary manipulations were unsuccessful in managing the ascites, and repeated large-volume paracentesis was necessary to provide symptomatic treatment. This is the first reported case of chylous ascites caused by sarcoidosis. "
digestive system diseases,"CT diagnosis of acquired small bowel volvulus. Small-bowel volvulus is an uncommon but important cause of small-bowel obstruction and often results in ischemia or infarction. Clinical examination and plain film radiography may be nondiagnostic, leading to delay in surgical intervention with subsequent increase in morbidity and mortality. We present two patients in whom the diagnosis of strangulating small-bowel volvulus was made by computed tomography (CT), allowing rapid surgical correction of this potentially life-threatening condition. "
digestive system diseases,"Collagenous colitis as a cause of chronic diarrhea. When the usual workup for chronic diarrhea fails to provide a diagnosis and the endoscopic findings are normal, alternative etiologies must be considered. This case of collagenous colitis represents such an alternative diagnosis. The patient is a 65-year-old woman who complained of abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea for an 8-month span. The key element to her diagnosis was subepithelial collagen deposits of the mucosa of the colon. Her symptoms were resolved with supportive care, diet, and diphenoxylate. Essential features and treatment of collagenous colitis are reviewed. "
digestive system diseases,Transcatheter treatment of splenic artery aneurysms (SAA). Report of two cases. Splenic artery embolization with steel coils was performed in two patients who both had large splenic artery aneurysms and hepatic cirrhosis complicated by hypersplenism. A good clinical effect was noticed after the procedure. It was concluded that this treatment is safe and effective and decreases the risk of splenic artery rupture. It also corrects hypersplenism. Transcatheter embolization appears to be a preferable alternative to surgery in such cases. 
digestive system diseases,"Intraperitoneal femoral venous catheter insertion with free blood return in presence of tense hemoperitoneum. The authors report a case of intraperitoneal insertion of a femoral venous catheter, with blood return, in a patient with hemoperitoneum. In such patients, skin puncture at or below the inguinal ligament is important. Aspiration of unusually dark blood and medial catheter location should raise the possibility of intraperitoneal catheter placement. "
digestive system diseases,"Pneumococcal peritonitis complicating CAPD--was the indwelling intrauterine device to blame? A 45-year-old woman on CAPD developed pneumococcal peritonitis. This is the second such case of Streptococcus pneumoniae peritonitis complicating CAPD. The role of an indwelling intrauterine device (IUD) in producing ascending infection into the peritoneum is discussed, especially in women with evidence of retrograde menstruation. A review of the literature concerning pneumococcal peritonitis associated with IUD is given. Possible contraception to women on CAPD is briefly mentioned. "
digestive system diseases,Interventional gallbladder procedures. Interventional radiologic procedures in the gallbladder are influencing both the diagnosis and therapy of many gallbladder disorders. Current diagnostic and therapeutic percutaneous techniques offer important alternatives for their management. This article highlights the spectrum of interventional radiologic techniques available for gallbladder diseases. 
digestive system diseases,Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for biliary stones. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is a noninvasive technique for treatment of patients with gallbladder and bile duct stones. Selected patients with gallbladder stones can be treated on an outpatient basis without general anesthesia and may return to full activity within 1 or 2 days. Stone-free rates of 40% to 60% at 6 months have been achieved in most reported series with minimal morbidity. Bile duct stone lithotripsy has achieved stone clearance in 80% of patients in whom conventional methods were unsuccessful and therefore constitutes a valuable second-line treatment for these patients. 
digestive system diseases,"Ultrasonic imaging of the abdomen. Report of the ultrasonography task force. Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Association. As new imaging modalities emerge and existing technologies improve, indications for a particular imaging method may change. This article examines current indications for abdominal and prostatic ultrasound examination and, where possible, compares ultrasound with other imaging techniques. This is not an attempt to list all possible ultrasound indications or examinations, but rather an attempt to serve as an aid to informed imaging selection based on current literature and equipment. "
digestive system diseases,"Hepatic fibrin-ring granulomas in a patient with hepatitis A. Hepatic fibrin-ring granulomas were found in a 30-year-old patient with serologically confirmed hepatitis A. Other causes associated with the presence of fibrin-ring granulomas in the liver, such as Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cytomegalovirus infection, visceral leishmaniasis, and consumption of allopurinol, were ruled out. It is suggested that hepatitis A must be included in the differential diagnosis of a patient with hepatic fibrin-ring granulomas. "
digestive system diseases,"Tongue atrophy in mixed connective tissue disease. A case is reported of tongue atrophy in a patient with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) and major myositic involvement. The case highlights oropharyngeal aspects of MCTD, including inability to wear dentures, dysarthria, and dysphagia. To our knowledge this is the first report of major tongue involvement in myositis as part of MCTD. "
digestive system diseases,"Emergency center ultrasonography in the evaluation of hemoperitoneum: a prospective study. The reliability of ultrasonographic detection (US) of hemoperitoneum in blunt abdominal trauma was evaluated in a prospective study of 72 patients. Independent of the examiner, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were, respectively, 86.7%, 100%, and 97.2%. Laparotomy was indicated in 76.9% of US hemoperitoneum-positive cases. No negative laparotomies were performed in this study group. If hemoperitoneum is revealed in US and vital signs are unstable, we think laparotomy is indicated. We believe that US in an emergency center is a quick, safe screening method in the evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma. US might take over a great part of the role of diagnostic peritoneal lavage. "
digestive system diseases,"Development of acute myelocytic leukemia in patients with Crohn's disease. In our hospital within one year two patients with Crohn's disease were seen who developed an acute myelocytic leukemia. A review of the literature reveals eight previously reported patients with both Crohn's disease and leukemia. Six of the reported 10 patients have had acute myelocytic leukemia and, interestingly, three of them, including our two patients, have shown monocytic differentiation (FAB type M4). It has been suggested that the relative risk of leukemia, especially acute myelocytic leukemia, is increased in patients suffering from ulcerative colitis. More data of patients with Crohn's disease and acute leukemia are needed to evaluate the possible association between these diseases. "
digestive system diseases,"Endoscopic management of chronic organoaxial volvulus of the stomach. Endoscopic correction of the chronic organoaxial volvulus of the stomach was attempted in seven cases of primary and three cases of secondary volvulus. Endoscopic correction was successful in six cases of primary volvulus and one case of volvulus secondary to duodenal carcinoma. This paper describes the details of the technique of endoscopic correction of gastric volvulus, and documentation of correction of the volvulus by barium meal study with a follow-up of 5-26 months. "
digestive system diseases,"Infectious diarrhea. Managing a misery that is still worldwide. Infectious diarrhea is the largest single cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. Bacteria, viruses, and protozoan parasites are the most common causative agents. Treatment in most cases of bacterial and viral diseases consists of correcting fluid loss and electrolyte imbalance by oral or parenteral rehydration. Antimicrobial therapy is reserved for very ill patients only. With the exception of Cryptosporidium, for which no effective agent is yet available, all protozoan infections are treatable with metronidazole. "
digestive system diseases,Posterior colporrhaphy and perineorrhaphy: separate and distinct operations. Posterior vaginal repair is often poorly understood and ineffectively performed. The goals of reconstructive surgery emphasize relief of symptoms and restoration of normal anatomic relationships and of function. A useful method to preoperatively determine posterior vaginal wall weakness is outlined along with a surgical description of important steps in surgical reconstruction. 
digestive system diseases,"The effectiveness of double-gloving in otolaryngology. Thirty-four sets of consecutively used double gloves (68 pairs) used by otolaryngologists and their assistants in operations known to have a high risk of glove punctures were studied. The perforation rates for the outer and inner layers were 35.3 and 8.8% respectively, indicating that a second set of gloves substantially improves the likelihood of maintaining an intact barrier between medical staff and patient. "
digestive system diseases,"Intra-abdominal palpation of a nasogastric tube in the stomach does not assure appropriate placement. Improperly placed nasogastric (NG) tubes have been associated with considerable morbidity. The only reliable indicator of correct NG tube placement appears to be the aspiration of gastric contents. We have reported a case of major morbidity from an improperly placed NG tube that perforated the cervical esophagus, dissected the mediastinum, and terminated in the omental bursa. No gastric aspirate was obtained by suctioning of the tube, but correct placement was presumed based upon the surgeon's direct intraoperative palpation of the tip of the tube. Failure to aspirate gastric contents should alert the practitioner to the possibility of improper NG tube placement. "
digestive system diseases,"Primary peritoneal sarcoidosis. A 14-year-old male was admitted for the evaluation of tense exudative ascites. Despite thorough evaluation, the diagnosis remained cryptic until peritoneoscopy revealed diffuse studding of the entire visualized peritoneum with multiple miliary nodules, and peritoneal biopsy demonstrated multiple noncaseating epithelioid granulomas. After other causes were excluded, a diagnosis of sarcoidosis was considered and confirmed with classic endobronchial findings at bronchoscopy. Involvement of the peritoneum with sarcoidosis is rare and, to our knowledge, only one other case describes this as the initial manifestation of this disease. "
digestive system diseases,Esophageal obstruction after ingestion of a fiber-containing diet pill. Foreign bodies of the esophagus in adults may be the result of a food bolus that becomes lodged proximal to a structural abnormality of the distal esophagus. A case of peptic stricture of the esophagus in a patient who presented with acute dysphagia after ingesting an over-the-counter diet pill composed of guar gum is discussed. It is recommended that anorectics composed of dietary fiber should not be used in patients with a history of esophageal stricture. 
digestive system diseases,"Congenital tracheoesophageal fistula associated with carcinoma of the lung in an adult. A rare case of adult congenital H-type tracheoesophageal fistula was diagnosed. Subsequently, at operation, large cell, undifferentiated carcinoma of the right middle lobe with extension to the right lobe and adherence to the diaphragm was documented. The diagnosis, surgical intervention, and 4-year follow-up are presented. "
digestive system diseases,"Should urologists wear spectacles for transurethral resection of the prostate? Contamination of the eyes by irrigation fluid during transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate was assessed by measuring droplet splashes on to spectacles worn by 2 surgeons. During 30 consecutive operations, droplet splash contamination occurred during every procedure. The number of splashes increased with time. The use of spectacles during TUR will reduce the risks of eye contamination from droplet splashes and therefore the possibility of transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus from infected patients. "
digestive system diseases,"Effects of indomethacin on hepatogenic pulmonary angiodysplasia. A patient had liver cirrhosis associated with marked hypoxemia. With administration of indomethacin (75 mg/day for six days), PaO2 was elevated up to 50 mm Hg from 44 mm Hg. At that time, dynamic pulmonary perfusion imaging revealed a plateau time course curve of MAA uptake in the lungs, as compared with findings obtained during the state of severe hypoxemia without indomethacin. These observations suggest that part of hepatogenic pulmonary angiodysplasia is a functional vasodilatation that is presumably modulated by vasoactive substances, such as prostaglandins and/or other eicosanoids. "
digestive system diseases,"Miliary tuberculosis presenting as hepatic and renal failure. A 67-year-old man developed hepatic and renal failure over a six-day period. Despite full supportive measures, he died on his 11th day of hospitalization with fulminant DIC and hepatic, renal, and respiratory failure. Postmortem examination revealed acid-fast bacilli in virtually all organ systems. Miliary tuberculosis should be considered as a potentially treatable cause of hepatic failure. "
digestive system diseases,"Cirrhosis and portal hypertension in a patient with adult Niemann-Pick disease. A woman with known Niemann-Pick disease, type B, presented at age 33 with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, ascites, and peripheral edema. Evaluation showed massive hepatosplenomegaly, infiltration of the liver with Niemann-Pick cells, cirrhosis, and evidence of portal hypertension. Chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocyctopenia, and platelet dysfunction were treated successfully by splenectomy. Cirrhosis and portal hypertension have not been reported previously in adult Niemann-Pick disease in the absence of some other cause. "
digestive system diseases,"Anal ulcerations due to cytomegalovirus in patients with AIDS. Report of six cases. Lesions due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) are frequent in the immunocompromised patient. This is particularly the case in patients with AIDS, where the colon and rectum are the regions most often involved. The authors report six cases of anal ulcerations due to CMV in patients with AIDS. These lesions, confirmed histologically, were either isolated or associated with other localizations. Treatment is based on specific antiviral agents but resistance and recurrence can occur. The current report underlines the importance of histologic examination of anal lesions in HIV-infected subjects. "
digestive system diseases,"Exacerbation of chronic active hepatitis type B after short-term corticosteroid therapy resulting in fatal liver failure. The case of a 36-yr-old male with chronic active type B hepatitis in whom 4-wk prednisone therapy resulted in prolonged and fatal exacerbation of liver disease is described. Thus, short-term corticosteroid therapy may in some patients have disastrous effects on the course of chronic active hepatitis B. "
digestive system diseases,Pharyngoesophageal perforation after blunt neck trauma. Pharyngoesophageal perforation secondary to blunt neck trauma is an uncommon injury that can cause serious morbidity and mortality if not recognized and treated. Pharyngeal perforation secondary to blunt trauma sustained while boxing is reported. Review of the world literature found 10 cases of pharyngoesophageal perforation secondary to blunt neck trauma. Analysis of these cases indicates that perforations less than 2 cm and limited to the pharynx may be treated medically with close observation. Large perforations and those perforations that extend to the esophageal inlet or involve the esophagus exclusively are best treated surgically. 
digestive system diseases,"Spontaneous rupture of the spleen in initial presentation of Hodgkin's disease. A 46-year-old man presented with a four-week history of fevers, occasional chills, and a two-week history of sweats and poor appetite. He also complained of progressive weakness and lethargy. After initial evaluation, while awaiting further consultation, the patient developed rapidly progressing abdominal pain and light-headedness. He was moved immediately into the emergency treatment area. He was noted to have an acute abdomen and was taken to surgery. An enlarged Hodgkin's-infiltrated spleen with an actively bleeding hematoma was removed. The patient denied any history of trauma. "
digestive system diseases,"Renal scintigraphy in the diagnosis and surgical management of a patient with caliceal colic: a case report. A patient with persistent renal colic and a caliceal stone is presented. Furosemide renography, commonly used to differentiate functional stasis from mechanical obstruction of an entire kidney or duplicated collecting system, can make this determination at the caliceal level. As in this case such determination can affect clinical management of the patient. "
digestive system diseases,"Isolated lipase and colipase deficiency in two brothers. Two brothers of Arab origin, aged 15 and 10 years, with isolated congenital lipase and colipase deficiency are described. Both were normally developed with a history of passing greasy stools since early infancy. Both have remarkable steatorrhoea and low serum carotene and vitamin E concentrations. After exocrine pancreatic stimulation, lipase and colipase activities in the duodenal fluid were almost completely absent, while amylase trypsin, bile salt, and pH values were normal. No other aetiology for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency was found. This is the first report of congenital combined lipase and colipase deficiency in two brothers. "
digestive system diseases,"Sexually transmitted causes of gastrointestinal symptoms in homosexual men. The possible etiologic agents that may cause gastrointestinal complaints in homosexually active men are multiple, and their diagnosis is complex. This article presents a logical approach to the work-up and diagnosis of gastrointestinal complaints in homosexually active men and to discuss their treatment and disease intervention. "
digestive system diseases,"Gastric outlet obstruction caused by traumatic pseudoaneurysm of superior mesenteric artery. Traumatic pseudoaneurysms of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) are extremely rare. We describe two cases of posttraumatic proximal SMA pseudoaneurysms with symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction. Repair was accomplished by aorta-SMA bypass with saphenous vein. Injuries to the proximal SMA are easily missed at laparotomy, especially if intestinal ischemia or hematomas are absent. Recognition and repair are stressed to avoid the complications associated with pseudoaneurysm formation. "
digestive system diseases,"Gastrointestinal tuberculosis. Report of four cases. Gastrointestinal tuberculosis is a rare disease in the United States. Correct identification is often delayed because it is not considered early on in the differential diagnosis. Four patients with gastrointestinal tuberculosis and the symptoms, diagnosis, complications, and treatment of the disease are discussed. Gastrointestinal tuberculosis should be considered in Asian immigrant patients who present with symptoms and signs of inflammatory bowel disease. "
digestive system diseases,"Endoscopy in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection. Two cases of mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAI) infection in association with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are presented to highlight the distinctive upper gastrointestinal endoscopic appearances: 2 X 4 mm diameter, white nodules with intervening erythema and hemorrhagic erosions covered the mucosa of the second part of the duodenum. Histological evaluation of these nodules revealed diffuse expansion of the lamina propria by macrophages that contained numerous intracellular and extracellular acid-fast organisms. We conclude that endoscopy with endoscopic biopsy may represent the most rapid and sensitive diagnostic tool available in this disease. "
digestive system diseases,"The importance of intraoperative cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) using electrocoagulation was successfully performed in 56 out of 58 selected patients. Cholangiography was performed in 53 patients. Six patients had common duct stones; five were unsuspected preoperatively. After the gallbladder was removed, three patients underwent open common duct exploration. In another five cases, anatomical anomalies were discovered. Cholangiography performed via the cystic duct before any structures are divided can prevent the most serious complication--common duct injury. Cholangiography should be attempted on all patients undergoing LC. "
digestive system diseases,"Inguinal hernia complicating flexible sigmoidoscopy. Flexible sigmoidoscopy has become part of routine preoperative workup for patients over the age of fifty who present with an inguinal hernia. A recent experience with two patients with a left inguinal hernia allowing sigmoid colon to herniate into the scrotum bring awareness of the possibility for an increased risk of perforation of the sigmoid colon during flexible sigmoidoscopy, or possible iatrogenic incarceration of the hernia. These cases are presented so this clinical entity can be recognized and the complications prevented. "
digestive system diseases,"Treatment of renal colic by prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors and avafortan (analgesic antispasmodic). In a study of the pain-relieving effect of 3 drugs commonly used to treat acute renal colic in this hospital, intravenous indomethacin and intramuscular diclofenac (prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors) were compared with intravenous Avafortan (analgesic antispasmodic). As first-line analgesics, prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, if given intravenously, offer an effective alternative to Avafortan. Of 145 patients studied, 32 required a second injection for complete relief of pain. Administering a second dose of prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors resulted in equally significant pain relief rate even though the route was intramuscular. "
digestive system diseases,"Penetration of the pericardium by a gastric ulcer--survival after pericardiocentesis. Elderly patients often have unusual manifestations of common illnesses. We describe a geriatric patient having a pneumopericardium from pericardial penetration by a gastric ulcer. Benign gastric ulceration causing perforation of the pericardium or other cardiac structures was recognized as early as 1854; however, until 1964, the condition was invariably fatal. Our patient survived the episode after early pericardiocentesis and medical treatment. Aspects of this uncommon clinical entity and a brief review of the literature are described. "
digestive system diseases,"Delayed presentation of intrapericardial diaphragmatic hernia, an unusual cause of colon obstruction. The earliest symptoms of diaphragmatic hernia may not appear until viscera incarcerate in it years after the causal injury. The most unusual site for a diaphragmatic hernia to occur is through the central tendon of the diaphragm into the pericardium. We present the case of a 43-year-old man who suffered a bowel obstruction when the transverse colon and omentum became incarcerated in the intrapericardial diaphragmatic hernia. The defect presumably resulted from blunt chest and abdominal trauma received 15 years earlier. The delayed presentation of intrapericardial diaphragmatic hernia is reviewed, and recommendations for evaluation and treatment are made. "
digestive system diseases,"Kawasaki-like syndrome after treatment with mesalazine. We report a patient who developed a severe hypersensitivity reaction, including rash, lymph node enlargement, fever, hepatitis, and eosinophilia, after sulphasalazine therapy. Five years later, he developed a similar reaction after exposure to mesalazine, the salicylic compound of sulphasalazine. We conclude that patients with known severe systemic reaction to sulphasalazine therapy are also at risk for such a reaction when treated with a 5-ASA preparation. "
digestive system diseases,"Appendiceal carcinoma masquerading as primary bladder carcinoma. We report 2 cases of appendiceal adenocarcinoma invading the bladder. Both tumors masqueraded as primary bladder carcinomas. Cystoscopic biopsies obtained adenocarcinomatous tissue and the secondary nature of the bladder lesion became apparent at laparotomy in both cases. One patient was treated with surgical resection of the appendix, the adjacent cecal wall and the bladder wall, and postoperative irradiation. She was well 10 years later. The other patient was treated with right colectomy and segmental bladder resection. She died of diffuse peritoneal recurrence 6 years later. "
digestive system diseases,"Computed tomographic and ultrasonographic findings in women with acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is associated with complications that can influence antepartum management and necessitate delivery. To date, liver biopsy has been regarded as the ""gold standard"" for diagnosis. Radiologic evaluation of the liver has been suggested as a less invasive means of diagnosing this entity. Five patients with acute fatty liver of pregnancy underwent ultrasonography; three underwent concomitant computed tomography (CT) of the liver. The liver appeared to be normal in all the patients undergoing CT evaluation and all undergoing ultrasonography except one. Normal liver examinations are not unusual findings in patients with acute fatty liver of pregnancy. "
digestive system diseases,"Pelvic pain: lessons from anatomy and physiology. Pelvic pain is often a difficult differential diagnosis in the emergency department. For physiologic reasons, pain in the pelvis is difficult to localize to a specific organ, and pelvic peritonitis is hard to recognize. On the other hand, differences in types of pain can be very useful in arriving at a correct diagnosis. The clinician must learn to recognize superficial and deep somatic pain, and differentiate between various types of visceral pain which originate from inflammation, ischemia, or colic. A review of the anatomy and physiology of pelvic pain helps identify some of the problems as well as potential aids in approaching the patient with pelvic pain. "
digestive system diseases,"Intrahepatic cholesterol stones: a rationale for dissolution therapy. A case of primary cholesterol hepatolithiasis is reported. Stone composition was documented by infrared spectroscopy, and the presence of cholesterol saturated bile was demonstrated using standard biochemical techniques. The patient was treated with operative stone extraction, choledochoscopy, biliary enteric anastomosis, and oral dissolution therapy. The administration of oral dissolution agents has altered the composition of the patient's bile and may prevent further stone formation. We advocate the use of both stone and biliary biochemical analysis for patients with primary hepatolithiasis to facilitate optimal therapy. "
digestive system diseases,"Acute urinary retention in a child with appendiceal abscess: diagnostic dilemma. Rarely do children with appendiceal abscess present with acute urinary retention as the only sign or symptom. This presentation may delay diagnosis and definitive therapy, thereby causing additional morbidity and possible mortality. We report the eighth case of acute urinary retention in a child associated with an appendiceal abscess. "
digestive system diseases,"Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder. A premalignant lesion? Gallbladder cancer is the most common malignant tumor of the biliary tract, but its early diagnosis is uncommon. The use of ultrasonography has increased the detection of benign gallbladder tumors, and the premalignant potential of gallbladder adenomas is now undisputed. Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder has recently been suggested to have malignant potential, and we report a case of adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder occurring in localized adenomyomatosis that was successfully treated by radical curative surgery. The more rigorous use of ultrasonography and a more aggressive approach to ""benign"" polypoid lesions of the gallbladder may represent the best way of achieving early diagnosis and cure in gallbladder cancer. "
digestive system diseases,"Association of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome) with herpes zoster. Ogilvie's syndrome, or acute pseudo-obstruction of the colon is characterized by massive distension of the colon in the absence of organic distal obstruction. The syndrome is associated with various unrelated and, most often, extra-abdominal causes. An association between Ogilvie's syndrome and herpes zoster has been reported only once, by Ceccese et al. in 1985. We present a second such case. This patient did not show evidence of any active illness other than the involvement of the T10 dermatome by herpes zoster. The patient's symptoms of colonic obstruction subsided with resolution of the zosteriform rash. "
digestive system diseases,"Asymptomatic rhabdomyolysis of unknown etiology. A 7-year-old boy developed rhabdomyolysis with a peak creatine phosphokinase level of 261,400 IU/L after his appendectomy. These abnormalities occurred following a 2-3-day illness consisting of upper respiratory tract symptoms, fever, and abdominal pain mimicking acute appendicitis. At the time of operation, a normal appendix was removed, and mesenteric lymphadenitis was noted. The myoglobinuria and elevation of creatine phosphokinase were transient, and the patient remained asymptomatic. We review various causes of right lower quadrant pain and rhabdomyolysis and address the roles of malignant hyperthermia and infectious agents. The possible cause of the phenomena observed in this patient is discussed. "
digestive system diseases,"Gastroesophageal reflux and sclerotherapy strictures. The development of esophageal stricture is common following endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy (EVS). Gastroesophageal reflux may be at least partly responsible. Twelve randomly selected male patients underwent chronic EVS for the management of bleeding esophageal varices. Six patients developed strictures during or after EVS, six did not. There were no significant differences between stricture and nonstricture patients during 24 hour esophageal pH monitoring. Three of the six stricture patients and four of the six nonstricture patients had an abnormal amount of reflux. Gastroesophageal reflux occurs frequently in patients undergoing EVS, and it is not likely to play a major role in EVS stricture formation. "
digestive system diseases,"Geriatric constipation: brief update on a common problem. Constipation occurs frequently in the elderly and is often multifactorial in origin. A search for an underlying cause is necessary, and can often be found by taking an adequate history and performing a thorough physical examination. A minority of patients require further investigation, guided by the clinical setting. Management should be directed at correcting the underlying cause and providing dietary advice and, less commonly, medication to allow restoration of a normal bowel habit. "
digestive system diseases,"Preoperative stabilisation in congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Between January 1983 and November 1986, 26 newborn infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia were treated by early operation at a mean of 7 hours of age. A further 23 infants admitted between December 1986 and December 1989 were stabilised for a mean period of 40 hours before operation. There was no significant difference in survival between the two groups. Delayed operation is not detrimental to infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. "
digestive system diseases,"Recurrent peritonitis: evidence for possible viral etiology. A 45-year-old woman who was treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) developed recurrent peritonitis characterized by cloudy effluents, elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts (predominantly lymphocytes), and negative culture results. This case report suggests that she may have had viral peritonitis as indicated by a positive viral culture, the presence of viral antibodies in serum and peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE), hematological findings, and cell surface receptor studies. The possibility of a viral cause should be considered in patients with culture-negative peritonitis, especially if they do not respond to antibiotics. "
digestive system diseases,"Prune belly syndrome in females: a triad of abdominal musculature deficiency and anomalies of the urinary and genital systems. We describe seven female patients with deficient abdominal wall musculature and urinary tract and genital anomalies that represent the female equivalent of the prune belly syndrome. Urethral atresia, uterine duplication, and anorectal anomalies occurred frequently. The perinatal mortality rate was high; of the four surviving patients, renal failure developed in two and renal transplantation was required. The analysis of these cases suggests that urethral obstruction is an important factor contributing to the development of the prune belly syndrome in females. "
digestive system diseases,"Collis gastroplasty: origin and evolution. In 1957 J. Leigh Collis published his innovative operation for treating the difficult problem of the irreducible hiatal hernia, esophagitis, and stricture. The design of the operation was based on the relatively primitive understanding of hiatal hernia and the newly emerging concept of reflux esophagitis. A variety of antireflux operations by different surgeons emerged over the years to follow. The original Collis gastroplasty has been subsequently modified with the addition of both partial and complete fundoplication procedures. The place of the modified Collis gastroplasty-fundoplication operations in today's approach to the problems of hiatal hernia and gastroesophageal reflux disease remains unsettled. "
digestive system diseases,"Transient mitral regurgitation due to mitral valve prolapse accompanied by systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. A grade 4/6 systolic murmur, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM), and severe mitral regurgitation (MR) documented by two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography developed suddenly on the structurally normal heart of a patient with idiopathic portal hypertension. The patient did not have signs of congestive heart failure and the aforementioned phenomenon disappeared completely when the patient was in hepatic failure. This could be explained by a change in circulating blood volume either by gastrointestinal hemorrhage or hepatic failure. "
digestive system diseases,"Duodenal-caval fistula. Duodenal-caval fistula is a rare, often lethal disease that requires prompt diagnosis and surgical correction. A case of duodenal-caval fistula due to duodenal ulceration is presented and discussed. "
digestive system diseases,"Heterotopic liver transplantation for fulminant Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease may present with severe acute hepatocellular failure. The only effective treatment for fulminant Wilson's disease is liver transplantation, which may lead to reversal of the underlying disease. Some patients with cirrhosis who are too ill to undergo orthotopic liver transplantation have been treated with heterotopic liver transplantation. However, use of heterotopic liver transplantation for fulminant hepatocellular failure has not been successful. This case study involves a patient in whom a heterotopic liver transplant was successfully used for treatment of Wilson's disease presenting with fulminant hepatocellular failure. "
digestive system diseases,"Light microscopic diagnosis of human microsporidiosis and variable response to octreotide. Microsporida are protozoan parasites that have recently been identified as a cause of human disease in immunocompromised patients. Because of their small size, they have been recognized primarily by electron microscopy. This has limited the study of their prevalence, incidence, and association with large-volume diarrhea. The present report describes two cases of Enterocytozoon bieneusi infection of the small intestine in patients with intractable diarrhea in whom the diagnosis was made by light microscopy and confirmed by electron microscopy. Both patients were treated with octreotide, and one had a good response. "
digestive system diseases,"Redevelopment of hepatitis B surface antigen after renal transplantation. A patient with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and chronic renal failure received a renal transplantation. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) disappeared, and antibodies to HBsAg appeared 10 months before transplantation. Liver tests showed no abnormality at transplantation. Six months later, chronic hepatitis reactivated, antibodies to HBsAg disappeared, and HBsAg reappeared. Hepatitis B virus DNA was demonstrated with polymerase chain reaction in the serum collected before transplantation. This observation suggests that low level HBV replication was present before transplantation despite the absence of detectable HBsAg and was reactivated under immunosuppressive therapy after transplantation. "
digestive system diseases,Intra-abdominal abscesses in Crohn's disease. We reviewed 22 patients who had intra-abdominal abscesses secondary to Crohn's disease. A total of 29 abscesses were discovered. These included superficial and deep intraperitoneal as well as pelvic and retroperitoneal abscesses. Diagnosis was aided by ultrasound and computer tomographic scanning. Barium studies continue to play an important role in delineating the extent of bowel involvement and fistulization. Treatment varied depending on the location and size of the abscess. The need for ultimate bowel resection was determined in the majority of cases by the presence of fistulization between the abscess cavity and the bowel. The terminal ileum or neoterminal ileum were almost always involved. 
general pathological conditions,"Fascinating rhythm: a primer on chaos theory and its application to cardiology. Nonlinear dynamics is an exciting new way of looking at peculiarities that in the past have been ignored or explained away. We have attempted to give a general introduction to the basics of the mathematics, applications to cardiology, and a brief review of the new tools needed to use the concepts of nonlinear mathematics. The careful mathematical approach to problems in cardiac electrical dynamics and blood flow is opening a window on behaviors and mechanisms previously inaccessible. "
general pathological conditions,"Bilateral intrapulmonary hematomas. A 67-yr-old man, known to have chronic obstructive lung disease, developed bilateral localized pulmonary densities on chest radiographs after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. An autopsy disclosed bilateral intrapulmonary hematomas without communication with bronchi, pulmonary arteries, or pleural cavities. We suggest blunt pulmonary injury is the most probable cause of the hematomas and discuss its pathogenic mechanism. Intrapulmonary hematomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary densities developing after a vigorous resuscitation. "
general pathological conditions,Primary abscess of the omentum. A 65-yr-old man presented with upper abdominal pain and fever due to a primary abscess of the omentum. The finding of microscopic-size foreign particles within the abscess raised the possibility of antecedent clinically silent perforation of the bowel or appendix. Surgical resection and antibiotic therapy were curative. 
general pathological conditions,"Endoscopic management of chronic organoaxial volvulus of the stomach. Endoscopic correction of the chronic organoaxial volvulus of the stomach was attempted in seven cases of primary and three cases of secondary volvulus. Endoscopic correction was successful in six cases of primary volvulus and one case of volvulus secondary to duodenal carcinoma. This paper describes the details of the technique of endoscopic correction of gastric volvulus, and documentation of correction of the volvulus by barium meal study with a follow-up of 5-26 months. "
general pathological conditions,"Cytogenetic evidence of clonality in a case of pigmented villonodular synovitis. Pigmented villonodular synovitis is an uncommon benign lesion that is characterized by diffuse synovial proliferation. Based on animal models, this lesion has been conjectured previously to be reactive in nature. In this report, the authors present the histologic and cytogenetic findings for a pigmented villonodular synovitis that was excised from the right knee of a 47-year-old man. Trisomy 7 was observed in 24 of 75 (35%) metaphases obtained from short-term culture of cells from this tumor. These findings suggest that some cases of pigmented villonodular synovitis represent clonal, neoplastic proliferations. "
general pathological conditions,"Decision criteria for pure-tone detection used by two age groups of normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners. Response criteria from a yes-no task and detection thresholds from two test procedures were measured for four groups of adults: younger normal-hearing, older normal-hearing, younger hearing-impaired, and older hearing-impaired. The two test procedures were an audiological procedure (which does not control for response bias) and a 21FC adaptive procedure (which does control for bias). The signal was a 500 or 4000 Hz tone presented in quiet. All four groups showed an equally conservative response bias in the yes-no task. In addition, neither age nor hearing loss affected the difference (6.5 dB) between the two threshold measures. "
general pathological conditions,"Aggressive oral refeeding in hospitalized patients. Malnutrition is an important clinical condition leading to increased morbidity and mortality. This report describes an aggressive oral refeeding program of high-caloric foods, which was instituted in severely anorectic patients because of their refusal to eat meals or supplements. After ascertaining a patient's favorite sweet, hospital personnel and family collaborated in providing the food. Frequently, sweets were the patient's only intake for weeks. We saw a gradual return of appetite, inclusion of other foods in the diet, and overall clinical improvement in comorbid conditions. These cases suggest that aggressive oral refeeding with high-caloric foods is an underutilized therapy for multiply impaired elderly patients. "
general pathological conditions,"Dislocation after primary arthroplasty for subcapital fracture of the hip. Wide range of movement is a risk factor. Dislocation is the most frequent serious complication following total hip replacement for subcapital femoral fracture. We report a prospective study, using matched groups, which compared the range of hip movement following hip replacement for arthritis and for fracture. The range of movement was significantly greater in the fracture group. We suggest that this is a predisposing factor for dislocation. "
general pathological conditions,Axillosubclavian vein thrombosis produced by retrosternal thyroid. Several causes of axillosubclavian vein thrombosis have been described. Trauma to the subclavian vein by pacemaker wires or central venous lines as well as the so-called effort thrombosis have been recognized as frequently diagnosed precipitating factors. A patient is herein presented with thrombosis of the subclavian vein caused by a giant substernal thyroid compressing the innominate vein. 
general pathological conditions,"Otological manifestations of a new familial polyostotic bone disorder. Fifty members of a family with a unique autosomal dominant bone disease were investigated. Nineteen of the family members were either known to have, or were strongly suspected of having the disease. All but one of these had a hearing loss which was conductive in the younger age group and mixed in the older members. The common finding in those who had middle ear surgery was replacement of the long process of incus by a fibrous band. The histological features were similar to those found in Paget's disease. The age of onset, distribution of lesions and radiographic findings, however, were not typical of this disorder. "
general pathological conditions,Mast cell heterogeneity in chronic idiopathic urticaria. Patients with chronic urticaria are more sensitive to codeine skin testing than other allergic individuals. Nonlesional skin in most patients with chronic urticaria was found to contain increased numbers of both total and atypical mast cells. The presence of increased mast cell density was found to correlate with the degree of clinical (dermatographism) and functional (codeine skin test) skin sensitivity. 
general pathological conditions,"Pyogenic hepatic abscess. Presented is a case of spontaneous pyogenic hepatic abscess in a previously healthy young man without associated risk factors. This disease entity has a low incidence, however, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality if diagnosis and treatment are delayed. "
general pathological conditions,"Multi-Hospital Eastern Atlantic Restenosis Trial: design, recruitment, and feasibility. M-HEART Investigators. A randomized control trial was set up to examine factors that influence restenosis and determine the effects of corticosteroids on restenosis following successful PTCA. The rationale for the study agent chosen, design, recruitment, and feasibility, as well as initial patient demographic data and initial results are presented. "
general pathological conditions,"Post-cannulation radial artery aneurysm--a rare complication. The following case report describes an expanding aneurysmal dilatation of the radial artery which developed 17 days following cannulation. Possible causes of this complication are: abnormal state of the vessel wall, multiple attempts at cannulation, and haematoma or infection at cannulation site. Other major and minor sequelae following arterial cannulation are reviewed. "
general pathological conditions,The growing teratoma syndrome. Thirteen patients with metastatic non-seminomatous germ cell tumours and enlarging metastases consisting of teratoma differentiated only were identified. Patients were managed with surgical resection soon after the growing lesions were documented. Surgical morbidity was minimal and 12 patients are alive (10 are disease-free) at a median follow-up of 28 months. 
general pathological conditions,Left ventricular aneurysm secondary to Behcet's disease. A 16-year-old boy with Behcet's disease who was seen with thrombophlebitis of the leg was found to have coronary artery occlusion with postinfarction left ventricular aneurysm. Recurrent femoral artery aneurysms and orogenital ulceration developed in him. The diagnostic features together with successful treatment of this patient and a discussion of Behcet's syndrome are presented. 
general pathological conditions,"Monozygotic twins discordant for partial trisomy 1. A 25-year-old primigravida delivered monozygotic twins discordant for multiple anomalies and partial trisomy 1 mosaicism. The phenotype of partial trisomy 1 includes craniofacial, central nervous system, and ocular anomalies. The most likely explanation for these findings is that the translocation occurred after twinning occurred. This observation emphasizes that monozygotic twins are not necessarily genetically identical. They are identical at conception, but subsequent mutation and rearrangement of the genome may cause substantial phenotypic differences. "
general pathological conditions,"Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. The mitochondrial diseases present with great heterogeneity. They are often multisystemic and vary considerably in age at onset, distribution of weakness, severity, and course. Only nonthyroidal hypermetabolism has a distinctive clinical presentation. Therefore, attempts at classification have generated some controversy. This article discusses the general classification that takes into account genetic and biochemical features, which has resulted from the fast pace of biochemical and molecular genetic investigations. "
general pathological conditions,"Loop ileostomy after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis--is it necessary? Construction of a loop ileostomy is usually advised in patients having an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis to minimize the complication of chronic pelvic sepsis. Formation and closure of a loop ileostomy was associated with a 41 percent and 30 percent complication rate, respectively, in a prospective series of 34 patients. This morbidity must now be assessed in relation to the benefits of avoiding temporary fecal diversion in restorative proctocolectomy. "
general pathological conditions,Adverse haemodynamic effects of high-dose aprotinin in a paediatric cardiac surgical patient. High-dose aprotinin for reduction of intra- and postoperative blood loss was associated with profound hypotension and flushing in a 3.5-year-old child who underwent cardiac surgery. Treatment with noradrenaline and intravenous fluid was required. Cardiovascular stability was restored after 10 minutes. 
general pathological conditions,"Preoperative piroxicam for postoperative analgesia in dental surgery. Fifty patients were allocated randomly to receive placebo or piroxicam 40 mg, 2.5 h before surgical removal of lower third molars under general anaesthesia. A significantly greater number of patients in the piroxicam group did not require opioid analgesia after operation (P less than 0.05). The piroxicam group also required fewer doses of paracetamol in the first 24 h after recovery from anaesthesia (P less than 0.05), and the time from recovery to first postoperative analgesia was longer in those patients who had received piroxicam (P less than 0.05). Piroxicam did not significantly prolong the duration of recovery from anaesthesia. "
general pathological conditions,"Simian virus 40 small tumor antigen and an amino-terminal domain of large tumor antigen share a common transforming function. The 82-residue amino-terminal sequences of simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (TAg) and small tumor antigen (tAg) are identical. Genetic analysis of TAg lacking amino acids 1-82 revealed that it was transformation-defective, as revealed by the agar growth assay, except when introduced in the presence of tAg. Since the latter, alone, lacks overt transforming activity, it would appear that the function of the sequence common to TAg and tAg is necessary, but not sufficient, for TAg transforming activity and that tAg can provide that function or its equivalent in trans. Thus, tAg may, in part, be viewed as a ""portable"" copy of a TAg functional domain. "
general pathological conditions,Splenic rupture in a human immunodeficiency virus-infected patient with primary splenic lymphoma. Splenic rupture presenting as primary malignant lymphoma of the spleen is a rare event. We report such an occurrence in a young man who had a primary B-cell immunoblastic lymphoma of the spleen and was found to be HIV-positive. We suggest that serologic tests for HIV should be performed in unusual cases of malignant lymphoma. 
general pathological conditions,"Buruli ulcer in Benin In a study of 28 patients with Mycobacterium ulcerans infection (Buruli ulcer) in Oinhi, Benin, it became clear that the disease can regress as well as progress, and that patients can have lesions of different stages simultaneously. A system of disease staging was introduced (I = subcutaneous nodule; II = cellulitis; III = ulceration; IV = scar formation). Research to find an effective treatment for this crippling disease is urgently needed. "
general pathological conditions,"Idiopathic bilateral spontaneous hyphemas. Spontaneous hyphemas are rare and usually associated with iris microhemangiomas or other vascular anomalies of the iris. In addition, various systemic problems can result in spontaneous hyphema. This is a case report of a bilateral spontaneous hyphema (recurrent in one eye), in which no predisposing condition could be identified after exhaustive hematologic evaluation and iris fluorescein angiography. "
general pathological conditions,"Characterization of ""peak E,"" a novel amino acid associated with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Epidemiologic studies strongly associate eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) with ingestion of tryptophan containing a contaminant (""peak E""). Prior reports have suggested that peak E is the di-tryptophan N alpha-animal of acetaldehyde. Spectral and chemical studies now demonstrate that peak E is 1,1'-ethylidenebis[tryptophan]. This novel amino acid may be the etiological agent responsible for EMS, or it may be a marker of a still unidentified causal agent. "
general pathological conditions,Fasciculations due to verapamil in a patient with neuropathy. A patient with pre-existing peripheral neuropathy developed generalized fasciculations under verapamil which ceased after discontinuation of the drug. It is suggested that the increase in acetylcholine (ACh) release at the neuromuscular junction by verapamil may trigger fasciculation in the state of regeneration at ACh-sensitive sites of axon terminals and immature axon sprouts. 
general pathological conditions,"The pitted duodenal bulb. The radiologic, endoscopic, and histologic findings in two patients with flaskshaped or collar-button collections of barium in the duodenum are presented. These abnormal mucosal depressions, which may be related to inflammation, were seen endoscopically and identified radiographically and have not been reported previously. "
general pathological conditions,"Aplasia cutis congenita and arteriovenous fistula. Case report and review. We describe a child with congenital aplasia cutis congenita of the scalp and an occult giant posterior fossa arteriovenous fistula. Previous case reports of central nervous system malformations associated with aplasia cutis congenita are reviewed. The exact incidence of such malformations is unknown. All patients with aplasia cutis congenita should undergo a neurologic evaluation, and their families should be examined for similar lesions. Early central nervous system imaging and other workup may be required, especially if plastic surgery in the head region is being planned. "
general pathological conditions,"Was CEPOD right? This retrospective study found that the long-term (greater than 6 months) postoperative survival in ASA 4E and 5E patients was 41% and 21% respectively, in 1986. This supports the Confidential Enquiry into Peri-operative Deaths' recommendation that life-saving surgery should not be withheld from patients who present in so serious a condition that they are unlikely to survive surgery. "
general pathological conditions,"Gastro-oesophageal reflux during elective laparoscopy. An oesophageal pH electrode was used to record gastro-oesophageal reflux in 73 women who had elective laparoscopy for various gynaecological procedures. No refluxes were recorded during the 63 procedures from which results could be analysed; the upper 95% confidence limit from this observation is 3 in 63 (4.8%). Two of the excluded women refluxed during episodes of hiccough that occurred shortly after induction of anaesthesia. Tracheal intubation may be required during laparoscopy, although the need to protect against the possibility of aspiration of gastric contents may not be a valid reason unless, with the same logic, it is suggested that all patients who hiccough should be intubated. "
general pathological conditions,"Acute porphyria presenting with hyperamylasemia. An elevation of serum amylase and lipase has not been reported previously to occur with porphyria. In this report, we describe a patient who presented with the clinical and laboratory picture of pancreatitis: elevated amylase, lipase, amylase-creatinine clearance ratio, and with abdominal pain. Only after extensive evaluation, was the patient found to have porphyria. On two separate occasions, with hematin therapy, her serum amylase decreased, as did her clinical symptoms of porphyria and her urinary quantitative porphyrins. This suggests an association between elevation of the serum amylase and lipase with acute porphyria. Moreover, this association can lead to delay in establishing the diagnosis of acute porphyria. "
general pathological conditions,"Muscle biopsy for diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility in two patients with severe exercise-induced myolysis. Muscle biopsy and in vitro contracture tests for diagnosis of susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia (MH) were performed in two patients who had developed fever and severe myolysis during exercise. MH susceptibility was confirmed in one patient, but in the other, exercise-induced heat stroke proved to be the correct diagnosis. Clinical presentation and epidemiology of exercise-induced MH and its relation to the heat stroke syndrome are discussed. "
general pathological conditions,"Rapid percutaneous tracheostomy We describe a new method of performing percutaneous tracheostomy rapidly and safely using a specialized instrument kit. The technique permits the safe insertion of a full-sized 7.0 (ID) or 7.5 mm (ID) cuffed cannula into the trachea within 1-2 min, through the membranous second intercartilagenous space. Animal studies have demonstrated a superior healing process compared to that seen after conventional tracheostomy techniques. "
general pathological conditions,Management of aortobronchial fistula with graft replacement and omentopexy. Massive hemoptysis due to a recurrent aortobronchial fistula after repair of a thoracic aortic aneurysm developed in a 64-year-old woman. The infected aortic tissue was resected and replaced with an in situ Dacron graft covered by omentum. The patient is alive and well 15 months later. 
general pathological conditions,Lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum: an unusual intraoperative finding. Lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum was an incidental finding in a man of 45 undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting for unstable angina. He was not overweight and did not have any rhythm disturbances. The diagnosis was made on frozen section. 
general pathological conditions,"Problem solving in implant dentistry. Dental implants have become an accepted form of dental care, with reported functional 5-year success rates of 90% and higher. These impressive statistics include, but do not identify, the problems that may have been created by clinical ineptitude. Diagnostic acumen and preventive measures at each stage of the implant treatment can avoid many problems. Also, appropriate measures of timely recognition, rescue, and repair can often restore ailing implants and their prosthetic appliances to full function. "
general pathological conditions,Acute hypercalcemic crisis after an open heart operation. Acute hyperparathyroidism developed in a previously normocalcemic 64-year-old woman during the first week after a coronary operation. Prolonged QT interval in the electrocardiogram and hypercalcemia were documented on the fourth postoperative day. Neck exploration on the fifth postoperative day revealed a lower right parathyroid adenoma. Parathyroidectomy resulted in rapid and dramatic improvement of the clinical picture and normalization of laboratory values. 
general pathological conditions,"The effect of spine fusion on respiratory function in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Serial measures of respiratory function were made in 17 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who underwent segmental spine fusion and in 22 patients who did not. No significant differences were observed between the 2 groups (operated vs. nonoperated) in terms of declining respiratory function. Nonetheless, all operated patients reported either improved sitting comfort, appearance, or both. Thus, our results suggest that there are distinct benefits from segmental spine fusion; however, there was no salutary effect upon respiratory function either in the short term or after up to 5 years follow-up. "
general pathological conditions,"Congenital duodenal diaphragm: conversion of stable chronic symptoms to subacute gastric outlet obstruction by penetrating foreign body. Congenital duodenal diaphragms (CDD) are rare lesions that usually become symptomatic and require surgery in childhood. We report a patient, who, although symptomatic since early childhood, had accommodated to the condition and finally required surgical correction in late life after an ingested foreign body traumatized the diaphragm, producing subacute gastric outlet obstruction. The condition, including the reconstruction of the precipitating event, was diagnosed endoscopically prior to surgery. "
general pathological conditions,"The endophthalmitis vitrectomy study [editorial] Endophthalmitis after cataract surgery can be a disastrous complication that may result in functional loss of an eye. All patients with this problem should receive direct injection of intravitreal antibiotics. The roles of initial vitrectomy and of intravenous antibiotics in treating this condition are controversial. Through a prospective, randomized, clinical trial, these issues can be assessed. We encourage ophthalmologists close to each clinical center to refer patients with postoperative endophthalmitis to these clinics. Questions concerning the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study can be addressed to the principal investigator at the nearest clinical trial center. "
general pathological conditions,"Anterior granulomatous uveitis in patients with multiple sclerosis. Granulomatous uveitis has infrequently been described as a manifestation of the autoimmune phenomena of multiple sclerosis (MS). The authors describe six cases of anterior granulomatous uveitis in patients with MS. All six patients had features of iridocyclitis and three patients had features of periphlebitis, which were suggestive of granulomatous disease. However, each patient had neurologic symptoms and signs consistent with MS and a negative laboratory workup for sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and syphilis. Testing for MS in a subgroup of patients with granulomatous uveitis of unknown etiology and neurologic symptoms may result in a diagnosis. "
general pathological conditions,"Flecked retina associated with ring 17 chromosome. We report the case of a mentally retarded male with a ring 17 chromosome who had subretinal drusen-like deposits in each eye. This is the second report of flecked retina in a patient with ring 17 chromosome, suggesting that there may be a causal relationship between abnormalities of chromosome 17 and retinal pigment epithelial or photoreceptor dysfunction. "
general pathological conditions,Cardiac arrhythmias from a malpositioned Greenfield filter in a traumatic quadriplegic. A case study is presented of premature Greenfield filter discharge with intracardiac migration and resulting life-threatening arrhythmias. These arrhythmias also interfered with the patient's transition from ventilatory support via orotracheal intubation to noninvasive positive airway pressure ventilatory support methods. The patient's arrhythmias were controlled by a demand cardiac pacemaker and cardiac glycoside therapy. No anticoagulants were used. She had no further filter migration nor significant complications for 16 months after hospital discharge. 
general pathological conditions,"Hemorrhoids. A practical approach to an aggravating problem. Although hemorrhoids are considered a minor medical problem, they may cause considerable discomfort and anxiety. Fortunately, treatment is often simple and surgery is rarely necessary. In this practical article, Dr Cocchiara describes internal and external hemorrhoids, a classification system, and treatment choices based on the degree of involvement. "
general pathological conditions,Hypertension after operative correction of club-foot deformity. Severe hypertension occurred as a postoperative complication after correction of a club-foot deformity in four children (seven feet) who were between the ages of two and three years and had no history of hypertension. The hypertension subsided slowly after administration of antihypertensive medications or more rapidly after release of the correction that had been obtained operatively. 
general pathological conditions,"Unusual posterior retinal holes associated with high myopia in XYY syndrome. A 49-year-old XYY man was found to have high myopia OU with unusual multiple retinal atrophic holes located in the posterior pole, unrelated to a posterior staphyloma or any other myopic degenerative changes. Most of the retinal holes showed signs of self-healing, with no evidence of vitreous traction or retinal detachment. High myopia and atrophic retinal holes have been found in other chromosomal disorders and in one sex-chromosomal abnormality. "
general pathological conditions,"Human immunodeficiency virus associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: successful treatment with zidovudine. Thrombocytopenia associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is well described, and two recent reports show a beneficial effect with the antiretroviral agent zidovudine (ZDV). HIV-associated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) has recently been observed, but the use of ZDV for it has not been previously described. We have reported a case of relapsing TTP in an HIV-positive man who achieved remission with plasmapheresis and antiplatelet therapy initially, but multiple relapses necessitated the addition of vincristine and ZDV to induce a sustained remission. "
general pathological conditions,"Traumatic asphyxia. Traumatic asphyxia is a distinctive clinical syndrome characterized by cervicofacial cyanosis and edema, multiple petechiae, and subconjunctival hemorrhage after a severe crush injury of the thorax or of the upper part of the abdomen. A case of traumatic asphyxia is reported, and its clinical and pathophysiologic features are discussed. "
general pathological conditions,"Complications in the use of sodium hypochlorite during endodontic treatment. Report of three cases. In endodontic treatment, solutions of sodium hypochlorite are widely used as an irrigating agent. It is an effective solvent of both necrotic and vital tissues, which makes it toxic to the surrounding tissues. Complications are rarely reported. Nevertheless, the acute symptoms caused by the toxic reaction must not be underestimated. Causes, treatment, and prevention of complications of sodium hypochlorite use are discussed, and three case reports are presented. "
general pathological conditions,Supravalvar aortic stenosis: a complication of aortic valve surgery. After a patient had aortic valvotomy and aortotomy for the relief of valvar aortic stenosis supravalvar stenosis developed over the next six years. 
general pathological conditions,"Simultaneous or staged bilateral total knee replacements in rheumatoid arthritis. A prospective study. In a prospective study of 100 knee arthroplasties in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, simultaneous bilateral surgery was compared with staged bilateral replacements. All patients had improved function following their operations but those who had staged surgery only achieved maximum benefit after the second knee had been replaced. The complication rate was no greater for simultaneous surgery and we therefore advocate the method for those patients who require bilateral replacements. "
general pathological conditions,"Reperfusion arrhythmias after thrombolysis. Electrophysiologic tempest, or much ado about nothing. Arrhythmias that may accompany myocardial reperfusion have generated significant clinical interest. First, there were concerns, based on animal studies, that high-grade ventricular tachyarrhythmias would pose a serious threat following thrombolytic therapy to treat an evolving myocardial infarction. Second, lower-grade arrhythmias, such as accelerated idioventricular rhythm, were cited as useful, noninvasive markers of successful reperfusion. Critical review of the current data, however, indicates that arrhythmias following thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction are usually neither dangerous clinical events nor consistent markers of reperfusion. "
general pathological conditions,"Vasopressin-related bullous disease of the legs. We report a 33-year-old man who developed cutaneous necrosis of the lower extremities with extensive bulla formation after i.v. administration of vasopressin for the treatment of bleeding esophageal varices. Due to its potent nonselective vasoconstrictive action, vasopressin not only may induce cardiac and gastrointestinal ischemia, but cutaneous ischemia as well. As in our patient, this may lead to extensive necrotic skin lesions at sites distant from the infusion. "
general pathological conditions,"A giant renal artery aneurysm diagnosed post partum. We report a case of a 5.8 cm. right renal artery aneurysm diagnosed intact 8 weeks post partum. Rupture of a renal arterial aneurysm during pregnancy is a rare but well described catastrophic event. There are no previous reports of an intact renal artery aneurysm diagnosed either ante partum or post partum. To our knowledge, this also represents the largest reported renal artery aneurysm. The aneurysm was repaired successfully with kidney salvage and closure of the fistulous connection to the renal vein. "
general pathological conditions,"The hyperimmunoglobulinaemia E and recurrent infections syndrome in an adult [published erratum appears in Thorax 1990 Dec;45(12):984] A 27 year old white woman with a history of chronic eczema and episodes of serious infection of the chest, skin, and bone presented with acute respiratory failure. She was found to have a spontaneous right pneumothorax and a pneumatocele in the left upper lobe. Despite a left upper lobectomy she was left with chronic respiratory failure, bullous lung disease, and bilateral bronchiectasis. The hyperimmunoglobulinaemia E and recurrent infections syndrome was diagnosed only in adult life. "
general pathological conditions,"Death notification. Family notification in sudden, unexpected, and violent death is a major responsibility of law enforcement, medical examiner, and coroner offices. This report reviews and discusses the process and procedures utilized in death notification and provides suggestions to accomplish this difficult task more effectively. "
general pathological conditions,"Cobb's collar--a forgotten entity. Cobb's collar or Moormann's ring is a stricture of the bulbar urethra which is largely unrecognised but has considerable relevance urologically as the site of congenital or post-instrumental strictures. The history, anatomy, embryology and surgical importance are reported. "
general pathological conditions,"Role of angioplasty in myocardial infarction management strategies: a review. The role of angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction has been extensively studied in the past few years. Although angioplasty in some circumstances can be the primary reperfusion intervention, logistic problems and the excellent results of intravenous thrombolytic therapy have resulted in postlytic angioplasty being the preferred use of this interventional strategy. Clinical trials of this strategy have not supported its routine use, however, and a much more selective application of postthrombolytic coronary artery dilation is advocated at this time. "
general pathological conditions,Aggravation of myasthenia gravis by erythromycin. Erythromycin is not currently recognized as causing clinical aggravation of myasthenia gravis. We report the case of a patient who experienced exacerbations of myasthenia gravis subsequent to each of several doses of intravenous erythromycin. We suggest that erythromycin can cause clinical worsening in patients with disease of the neuromuscular junction. 
general pathological conditions,"Triggers of transient myocardial ischemia: circadian variation and relation to plaque rupture and coronary thrombosis in stable coronary artery disease. The phenomenon of transient myocardial ischemia is common in patients with stable coronary disease and appears to be due both to increases in myocardial demand and to episodic coronary vasoconstriction. The circadian variation of transient ischemic episodes closely parallels the circadian variation of acute coronary syndromes associated with plaque rupture, such as myocardial infarction and sudden death. These concordant temporal patterns of transient ischemia, myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death probably represent independent manifestations stemming from the consequences of increased sympathetic activity. "
general pathological conditions,The modified Schollner costoplasty. The modified Schollner costoplasty is a cosmetic procedure for the correction of rib prominence deformity in scoliosis. We present the results of the procedure in 21 patients who had previously undergone spinal fusion for scoliosis. We found the procedure to be well tolerated without major complications. Objective cosmetic improvement was achieved in all but one case. All but one patient considered the procedure to have been of cosmetic benefit. 
general pathological conditions,"Magnetic resonance imaging of congenital heart disease in the pediatric patient. Current state-of-the-art MR imaging offers a high resolution evaluation of cardiac anatomy in the child with congenital heart disease. Although echocardiography remains the standard initial evaluation modality, MR imaging plays a key role in supplementing this information in the pediatric thorax. Although applications for this modality continue to be defined, some indications have become clear. The future of MR imaging promises better spatial resolution, faster image acquisition times, and in vivo spectroscopic capabilities. "
general pathological conditions,"Reoperation for biliary strictures. Benign bile duct strictures most often follow intraoperative injury not recognized until later. The ideal reconstruction entails a mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis without tension, usually with a stent tube to maintain patency in the immediate postoperative period. The mortality rate for reoperation and bile duct reconstruction in patients who are not cirrhotic is approximately 2%, and success rates average 85%. Prevention of operative injuries by the use of cholangiography, careful dissection, and removal of the gallbladder from the fundus downward is the best treatment. "
general pathological conditions,"Abdominal trauma in pregnancy. When is fetal monitoring necessary? The type and duration of observation and monitoring of mother and fetus after abdominal trauma are dependent on gestational age and severity of trauma. Fetal monitoring is usually not required when the fetus is not viable; the primary consideration is the safety of the mother. When the fetus is viable, 24-hour inpatient fetal monitoring is indicated in cases of major trauma, even when no symptoms of injury are obvious. "
general pathological conditions,"Pelvic resections: the Rizzoli Institute experience. Materials, methods, and techniques of pelvic resections are discussed. Results, including the complications of nerve damage, infection, and vascular, visceral, and reconstructive complications are tabulated. "
general pathological conditions,"Botulinum toxin therapy. Botulinum toxin therapy has emerged as a treatment modality for a variety of spastic- or contracture-related muscle diseases. Its safety has been proven for long-term use in the treatment of benign essential blepharospasm, hemifacial spasm, and certain types of strabismus. Recent approval from the Federal Drug Administration should make botulinum toxin available for use in a greater number of patients. "
general pathological conditions,"Acute pulmonary oedema following administration of ornithine-8-vasopressin. We report the case of a patient who developed acute pulmonary oedema following a short and uneventful surgical procedure. Among the differential diagnoses, the role of ornithine-8-vasopressin is emphasized. "
general pathological conditions,"Ascites after rupture of dissecting aortic aneurysm into the right atrium. We report successful repair of an aneurysmal aorta-right atrial fistula causing intractable ascites. The clamped ""ascending aorta"" was drained for mixed return after perfusion through the femoral vessels and opened during hypothermic arrest. Return cannulation through the fistula permitted definitive repair. "
general pathological conditions,"Molecular analysis of acute promyelocytic leukemia breakpoint cluster region on chromosome 17. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; FAB M3) is characterized by a predominance of malignant promyelocytes that carry a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17, t(15;17) (q22;q11.2-q12). This translocation has become diagnostic for APL, as it is present in almost 100 percent of cases. A Not I linking clone was used to detect this translocation initially on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and subsequently with conventional Southern (DNA) analysis. The breakpoints in ten APL cases examined were shown to cluster in a 12-kb region of chromosome 17, containing two CpG-rich islands. The region is the first intron of the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene (RARA). "
general pathological conditions,"Cytomegalovirus in a macerated second trimester fetus: persistent viral inclusions on light and electron microscopy. The macerated stillborn fetus represents at least one third of all perinatal deaths. Microscopic examination of these specimens is often unrewarding. We have reported a clinically unsuspected cytomegalovirus infection in a second trimester macerated fetus. Cells suggestive of CMV inclusions were identified by light microscopy, but electron microscopy confirmed the presence of viral infection and proved valuable in making the diagnosis even though necrosis was severe. "
general pathological conditions,"Urological complications in 350 consecutive renal transplants. Ten urological complications (2.9%) were found in 350 kidney transplants performed in this centre. These included obstructive uropathy (20%), urinary leaks (40%), distal uretic fistulas (necrosis) (30%) and renal calculi (10%). Two grafts were lost due to chronic rejection 9 and 30 months post-operatively. The remaining 8 patients have stable renal function (mean creatinine 1.5 mg%). It was concluded that meticulous surgical technique may reduce the number of urological complications and early diagnosis and prompt surgical treatment may help to save the grafts. "
general pathological conditions,"Ocular defects in infants of extremely low birth weight and low gestational age. The eyes of 49 babies who weighed less than 1,000 g at birth or who were born at or before 28 weeks gestation were examined at the age of 4 years. Twenty-one children were normal. The remaining 29 children (59%) had ocular abnormalities which ranged from mild amblyopia to blindness from retinopathy of prematurity. The need to examine children at risk is stressed. "
general pathological conditions,"Infrarenal abdominal aortic disease: a review of the retroperitoneal approach. Transabdominal exposure is the most widely used surgical approach to the infrarenal aorta. Over the last 30 years a number of surgeons have championed the retroperitoneal approach for repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms and aortoiliac occlusive disease using a variety of incisions. Several studies attest to the clinical superiority of this approach over the transabdominal route and recent evidence demonstrates reduced physiological disturbance with this technique. The retroperitoneal approach is suitable for all elective operations on the abdominal aorta, particularly in patients with high-risk aneurysms and in selected patients with symptomatic and ruptured aneurysms. "
general pathological conditions,Treatment of severe acne with isotretinoin in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Four patients with inflammatory bowel disease and severe cystic acne were treated with isotretinoin. Two patients had a successful course of treatment without any gastrointestinal side-effects. One patient had two episodes of profuse rectal bleeding that were probably related to pre-existing haemorrhoids. The fourth patient had a flare-up of his Crohn's disease after starting isotretinoin. 
general pathological conditions,"The use of flumazenil in a neonate. Side effects of benzodiazepines used during pregnancy are described in a neonate. Recurrent apnea was reversed after administration of flumazenil, a specific antagonist of benzodiazepines. "
general pathological conditions,"Metastatic tumors of the umbilicus: a review 1830-1989. Umbilical metastases from known and unknown primary cancers are rare. The eponym ""Sister Mary Joseph's nodule"" has been used by generations of physicians. The first reports of this clinical sign were from Walshe in 1846. A review of the literature revealed 265 cases from then until 1989. Only 85 cases of umbilical metastasis from unknown primary tumors were found. This review should help us to focus on the common and uncommon primary sites in the diagnosis of patients with this finding. A single case report and the work-up for the hidden primary tumor are described. "
general pathological conditions,"Management of arginine monohydrochloride extravasation in the forearm. We initially observed our patient, who had subcutaneous arginine monohydrochloride extravasation in the volar forearm, until his wound demarcation was complete. After wound demarcation, we proceeded with debridement and partial-thickness skin grafting. Upper extremity function was totally normal 3 months after this therapy. This is the first case report in the literature that describes a child with an arginine monohydrochloride-induced extravasation necrosis. "
general pathological conditions,"Experience with childhood urolithiasis. Report of 196 cases. A total of 196 children with urinary calculi were treated surgically. Their ages ranged from 1 to 14 years. The male:female ratio was 3:1. Stones were located in the kidney in 96 patients, in the bladder in 52 and in the ureters in 32. Multiple organ involvement was present in 16 patients and associated urinary tract anomalies were found in 11. Stone analysis revealed calcium oxalate and phosphate stones in 121 patients, struvite stones in 60 and uric acid stones in 15. "
general pathological conditions,"Leukemias of indeterminant lineage. Two biologically and clinically important forms of acute leukemia have been described. Evidence suggests that both undifferentiated acute leukemia and many types of hybrid leukemia arise from relatively fewer differentiated cells than do the more straightforward acute leukemias. Clinical correlations suggest that patients with these leukemias may have a poorer prognosis, although some findings may be associated with an improved prognosis. More data in which multiple techniques are applied to the same leukemic cells are clearly needed. Patients with certain types of hybrid leukemias may be suitable candidates for more aggressive forms of chemotherapy or, possibly, combinations of therapy directed at cells of both lineages. "
general pathological conditions,Nortriptyline treatment of depressed cardiac transplant recipients. The safety of tricyclic antidepressants in cardiac transplant recipients has not been established. The author used nortriptyline to treat major depressive episodes in eight cardiac transplant recipients. Nortriptyline therapy was associated with increased QRS interval and heart rate but did not significantly affect other hemodynamic or ECG variables or cyclosporine dose requirements. It appears that nortriptyline may be used safely in depressed cardiac transplant patients. 
general pathological conditions,"Choroid plexus cysts and chromosomal defects During a 4-year period, 83 pregnant women with fetal choroid plexus cysts were investigated in our unit. Abnormal karyotypes were found in 20 fetuses, including trisomy 18 (n = 16), trisomy 13 (n = 1), triploidy (n = 1) and translocation Down's syndrome (n = 2). All fetuses with chromosomal defects had structural malformations in addition to the choroid plexus cysts. "
general pathological conditions,Continued need for pneumococcal prophylaxis after splenectomy Two children died from pneumococcal infection five and eight years after splenectomy. Pneumococcal vaccination had not been given to either child. When the infection developed both children were not taking prophylactic penicillin. Vaccination and daily penicillin reduce the incidence of this complication and therefore we strongly recommend that both of these measures are continued indefinitely. 
general pathological conditions,"False aneurysm formation of the great arteries after arterial switch operation. An infant with simple transposition of the great arteries underwent a two-staged arterial switch operation, after which mediastinal infection occurred. Continuous irrigation with povidone-iodine solution was performed for 10 days. After that, the patient experienced life-threatening hemorrhage three times. At the time of the second hemorrhage, greater omental transfer was performed. On postoperative day 109, false aneurysm was recognized, having developed from both great arteries. Successful repair was performed on postoperative day 110. "
general pathological conditions,"Tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesions of the head and neck. The term 'tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion' has been used to describe a fibrosclerosing disorder which has a locally destructive nature but is characterized by a benign histological appearance. We report five patients, over a five year period, with such a lesion. The clinical behaviour and surgical findings suggest the lesion to be an invasive malignancy. However, the histological appearance of an admixture of chronic inflammatory cells and fibrosis is consistent with a benign condition. We recommend surgical excision of the lesion as the mainstay of treatment; other studies report the use of steroids and radiotherapy. "
general pathological conditions,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma in a patient with surgically treated achalasia. Although squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus occurs with increased incidence in primary achalasia, esophageal adenocarcinoma has been considered rare in this condition. We report a patient with long-standing achalasia in whom adenocarcinoma of the esophagus occurred many years after Heller esophagomyotomy, presumably related to Barrett's esophagus complicating gastro-esophageal reflux disease. "
general pathological conditions,"Delayed rupture of a pseudoaneurysm of the costocervical trunk: treatment with therapeutic embolization. Fourteen days after removal of an internal jugular catheter inserted prior to renal transplantation, a patient presented with brisk arterial hemorrhage from the insertion site. The hemorrhage, caused by a ruptured pseudoaneurysm of the costocervical trunk, was controlled by transcatheter embolization with gelatin particles. One year later the patient reported no problems related to the pseudoaneurysm or its management. "
general pathological conditions,"Cancer in relatives of survivors of childhood sarcoma. Relatives of 88 long-term survivors of childhood sarcoma were examined for the familial cancer syndrome of sarcoma, breast cancer, and other neoplasms (Li-Fraumeni syndrome). Twenty-six of 402 close relatives developed cancer (expected, 23.8), including breast cancer in four mothers (expected, 3.1). Two sarcoma probands who developed second malignant tumors have multiple relatives with cancer and might have an inherited predisposition. An increased cancer risk and exceptional requirement for disease screening appear to be confined to first-degree relatives of a small fraction of children with sarcoma, notably probands with second cancers. "
general pathological conditions,"Ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction during pregnancy. Many women with cerebrospinal fluid shunts are now reaching reproductive age. Shunt malfunction may occur during pregnancy, and management requires a well-planned, combined neurosurgical and obstetrical approach. We present a case of ventriculoperitoneal shunt obstruction manifesting during the third trimester managed successfully in a conservative fashion. The literature on ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction during pregnancy is reviewed. "
general pathological conditions,"Vitamin B6 in the treatment of the premenstrual syndrome--a review [published erratum appears in Br J Obstet Gynaecol 1991 Mar;98(3):329-30] A search of the literature yielded 12 controlled trials on vitamin B6 in the treatment of the premenstrual syndrome. These are discussed with emphasis on methodological aspects. A major drawback of the trials is the limited number of patients included. The existing evidence of positive effects of vitamin B6 is weak, and some well-designed trials with positive results would be needed to change this view. "
general pathological conditions,"Ultrasonographic findings of testicular microlithiasis associated with intratubular germ cell neoplasia. Testicular microlithiasis is an uncommon condition in which calcified concretions fill the lumina of seminiferous tubules. We report the case of a twenty-three-year-old white man with a metastatic germ cell tumor and normal findings on testicular physical examination, but abnormal ultrasonography of the right testis. Orchiectomy revealed intratubular germ cell neoplasia with testicular microlithiasis. Multiple circular echogenic foci on ultrasound correlated with the histologic finding of testicular microlithiasis. Further studies are indicated for assessing ultrasonography as an adjunct for screening the population at risk for intratubular germ cell neoplasia. "
general pathological conditions,"Intrahepatic cholestasis due to hypersensitivity reaction to procainamide. Hypersensitivity reactions to procainamide involving liver dysfunction are rare. We describe a patient who developed liver dysfunction after procainamide administration, manifested by fever, jaundice, elevated bilirubin concentration, and alkaline phosphatase concentration. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy demonstrated good hepatic uptake of the radionuclide without movement from hepatic parenchyma. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of procainamide-induced intrahepatic cholestasis as demonstrated by radionuclide hepatobiliary scintigraphy. "
general pathological conditions,Gastric infarction. We have described a patient with an acute condition of the abdomen who had infarction of the stomach and the small intestine due to atheromatous thrombus of celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. We believe this unusual simultaneous occurrence of gastric and small intestinal infarction is coincidental. The outcome of gastric infarction is frequently fatal. 
general pathological conditions,"Infectious mononucleosis presenting as bilateral acute dacryocystitis. A case of infectious mononucleosis presenting as bilateral acute dacryocystitis in a 7-year-old girl is reported. Acute dacryocystitis is uncommon in this age group, and an underlying systemic illness should be suspected particularly when it is bilateral. "
general pathological conditions,"Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome in association with L-tryptophan ingestion. The association between the recently described eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and L-tryptophan is now well established. We describe a patient with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome who developed incapacitating myalgias and peripheral eosinophilia responsive only to high dose corticosteroids. When massive upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage developed while receiving corticosteroid therapy, surgery was complicated by striking abdominal wall rigidness. A discussion of this case and of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome is presented. "
general pathological conditions,"Acceleration of scrapie in trisomy 16----diploid aggregation chimeras. We studied the susceptibility to prion infection of the trisomy 16----diploid chimeric mouse, a putative model of Down syndrome. When weanling chimeras were inoculated intracerebrally with scrapie prions, the time until appearance of the first symptoms of scrapie was reduced by 17 days (from a mean control time of 153 days) and the time to death was reduced by 30 days (from control time of 170 days). Our results with trisomy 16 chimeras argue that the susceptibility to central nervous system degeneration caused by prions can be modulated by chromosome imbalance. "
general pathological conditions,Nuclear techniques for the analysis of urinary calculi. Sections of urinary calculi were prepared and point-by-point analyses along a line-scan were carried out using the techniques of proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) and nuclear reaction analysis (NRA). Correlations between several pairs of elements (including trace elements) were noted and it was also clear that the composition of a stone varied markedly at different stages of development. 
general pathological conditions,"When do optic disc edema and peripheral neuropathy constitute poetry? [clinical conference] A patient with chronic, bilateral optic disc edema developed multiple systemic manifestations of POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, skin changes). A serum immunoelectrophoresis showed an abnormal serum IgG lambda protein, and urine immunoelectrophoresis revealed a monoclonal lambda protein plus an IgG lambda fragment. Bone survey and MRI scan revealed a sclerotic lesion of the first lumbar vertebra, and lymph node biopsy showed changes consistent with Castleman's disease. Thus, his optic disc edema was the presenting feature of the POEMS syndrome and osteosclerotic myeloma. "
general pathological conditions,"Radiculomegaly of canines and congenital cataracts--a syndrome? Radiculomegaly of single teeth is very uncommon. Our survey indicates that the canine tooth is most frequently affected. Although illustrated in a number of texts of dental anatomy, there is a lack of detailed case reports. "
general pathological conditions,Septic Streptococcus milleri spondylodiscitis. We describe 2 patients presenting lumbar spondylitis due to Streptococcus milleri. In both cases origin was related to preexistent intestinal pathology. Surgical drainage of a collection of pus was necessary in one case. Longterm antibiotic therapy led to full recovery. Despite confused nomenclature Streptococcus milleri must be considered a serious pathogen mainly associated with purulent infection with osteoarticular affinity. 
general pathological conditions,"Anaesthetic hazards of aortocaval fistula. A 66-yr-old man was anaesthetized for repair of a suspected ruptured aortic aneurysm. He became deeply cyanosed and suffered two episodes of asystole as the surgeons entered the abdomen. After the aorta was cross-clamped his condition improved markedly and no further problems ensued. Surgical exploration demonstrated intact aneurysms of the aorta and left iliac artery, the former containing a 3-4 cm long aortocaval fistula. The aneurysms and fistula were repaired and his further course was uncomplicated. Potential causes for the cyanosis and cardiac arrest in this patient are discussed. "
general pathological conditions,"Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. A retrospective review of 94 patients who had undergone anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was performed to analyze the result in patients who had a diagnosis of posterolateral spondylosis, disc herniation, or both. Although in 23 of 94 patients additional adjacent asymptomatic levels of spondylosis were noted, only the symptomatic levels were addressed in the 94 cases. Postoperatively two cases of dysphagia were noted, as well as a 4% pseudarthrosis rate. There was an 88% good or excellent result when no additional spondylosis was present, but only a 60% good or excellent result when just the symptomatic levels were addressed, leaving unoperated adjacent levels of spondylosis. "
general pathological conditions,"Subcutaneous emphysema producing airway compromise after anesthesia for reduction of a mandibular fracture. A case report and review of the literature. Subcutaneous emphysema can occur as the result of trauma, surgery, and anesthesia. A case is presented of extensive subcutaneous emphysema after anesthesia for oral surgical reduction of a mandibular fracture. A discussion of the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of subcutaneous emphysema follows. "
general pathological conditions,"Vascular lesions of the intestines. This article reviews the pathology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of vascular lesions of the intestine as a cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. In addition, a modified system for classifying such lesions, based on the author's personal experience with such lesions, is presented. "
general pathological conditions,"Reoperative versus conservative management for gastrointestinal fistulas. Development of a fistula is a serious complication. It is necessary to identify its anatomic and pathologic features, as these can influence the outcome of treatment independent of the primary disease. Electrolyte abnormalities should be addressed as volume deficits are being restored. Sepsis, the most common cause of death in patients with fistulas, must be controlled, and the skin must be protected. Reoperation and conservative management are not opposing forms of therapy but rather are complementary. "
general pathological conditions,"Indigenous cases of Lyme disease diagnosed in North Carolina. Between January 1984 and December 1989, 102 indigenous cases of Lyme disease were reported in North Carolina. Lyme disease was reported in each of the three major geographic regions of the state: mountain, piedmont, and coastal plain. One or more diagnoses were made in 42 of 100 counties. Patients ranged in age from 5 months to 78 years (median, 27 years); 58 patients (57%) reported a history of tick exposure within 1 month of the onset of symptoms. Erythema migrans was reported by 93 patients (91%). Arthritis (30%), neurologic symptoms (10%), and cardiac abnormalities (7%) were observed. Thirty of the 102 cases were confirmed serologically by indirect fluorescence microscopy or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. "
general pathological conditions,"Managing geriatric arrhythmias, I: General considerations. Cardiac arrhythmias become increasingly common as people age, but they are not always clinically significant. Sinus node dysfunction, AV conduction disturbances, and ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias will be found but are not always symptomatic. Treatment of asymptomatic arrhythmias is controversial and probably not indicated, but in symptomatic elderly, therapy is indicated, since even the very elderly have been found to benefit from it as much as younger patients. There are specific guidelines, however, that apply to this age group based on its susceptibility to side effects. "
general pathological conditions,"Effects of indomethacin on hepatogenic pulmonary angiodysplasia. A patient had liver cirrhosis associated with marked hypoxemia. With administration of indomethacin (75 mg/day for six days), PaO2 was elevated up to 50 mm Hg from 44 mm Hg. At that time, dynamic pulmonary perfusion imaging revealed a plateau time course curve of MAA uptake in the lungs, as compared with findings obtained during the state of severe hypoxemia without indomethacin. These observations suggest that part of hepatogenic pulmonary angiodysplasia is a functional vasodilatation that is presumably modulated by vasoactive substances, such as prostaglandins and/or other eicosanoids. "
general pathological conditions,"Duodenal-caval fistula. Duodenal-caval fistula is a rare, often lethal disease that requires prompt diagnosis and surgical correction. A case of duodenal-caval fistula due to duodenal ulceration is presented and discussed. "
general pathological conditions,Epidural haematoma requiring surgical decompression following repeated cervical epidural steroid injections for chronic pain. We report a case of epidural haematoma following a steroid injection into the cervical epidural space. The complication occurred on the seventh such injection over a 2 year period for chronic spinal pain. Surgical decompression over the seventh cervical and the upper 3 thoracic vertebrae was required to alleviate the symptoms of paralysis and anaesthesia. The patient subsequently required skin grafting to the surgical site and two trans-urethral resections of the prostate gland during his 6 week hospital admission. He made a full recovery. 
general pathological conditions,Pregnancy associated with Gorlin's syndrome. A pregnant woman with Gorlin's syndrome presented for the removal of malignant ovarian tumours. The main problem encountered by the anaesthetists was an unexpected increase in arterial blood pressure. This was most probably associated with surgical manipulation of the ovaries with an increase in prorenin/renin production. 
general pathological conditions,Hemifacial spasm caused by a spontaneous dissecting aneurysm of the vertebral artery. Case report. The authors describe the first reported case of dissecting aneurysm presenting with hemifacial spasm. The patient was a 58-year-old woman with left hemifacial spasm of 2 years' duration. Cranial nerve examination was otherwise normal and no other clinical symptoms were observed. Vertebral angiography revealed a fusiform enlargement of the left vertebral artery and contrast medium remaining in the intramural false lumen in the venous phase. Microvascular decompression of the facial nerve with wrapping of the aneurysm resulted in complete relief of the hemifacial spasm. 
general pathological conditions,"Full recovery after a chloroquine suicide attempt. The nonfatal case of a 20 year-old woman who ingested 6 grams of chloroquine in a suicide attempt is reported. After initial ventricular fibrillation, she rapidly developed a pulmonary edema with cardiogenic shock. She was successfully treated with diazepam, epinephrine, dobutamine and mechanical ventilation. Plasma chloroquine levels showed an initial peak of 36 micrograms/mL. The patient was discharged fully recovered after 19 days. The interaction between chloroquine and diazepam is discussed, as is the need for careful management of epinephrine therapy. "
general pathological conditions,"Genetics and psychiatry: an unheralded window on the environment. Two recent reviews in the American Journal of Psychiatry and the British Journal of Psychiatry reported on progress in understanding the genetics of psychiatric disorder. Both reviews focused on this progress as a prelude to psychiatric diagnostics and therapeutics based on molecular biology. Neither review recognized that the latest data in behavioral genetics support environmental causes for abnormal development and psychopathology as much as they support genetic causes. Moreover, these genetic data point clearly to a type of environmental cause with central importance: the environment that is specific or unique to each sibling in a family. "
general pathological conditions,"The role of the clinical microbiology laboratory in transplantation. The clinical microbiology laboratory plays a central role in any transplantation program. Pretransplantation microbiologic testing often determines prophylactic treatment, donor selection, and blood product use. With suspected infection, rapid microbiologic tests permit prompt therapy but are challenged by an ever-changing diversity of potential pathogens and limited specimen size. Antigen detection and the polymerase chain reaction with nucleic acid hybridization are newer methods that promise earlier detection of such serious infections as disseminated aspergillosis and primary cytomegalovirus and may reveal new microbial causes of various posttransplantation syndromes. "
general pathological conditions,"Urinary tract infections. Urinary tract infections are a common infection for the primary care physician to see in the office. Epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, management, and prophylaxis are discussed. Information regarding special patient populations, such as pregnant women and children, is also provided. "
general pathological conditions,"Italian experience of voice restoration after laryngectomy with tracheoesophageal puncture. This report concerns 102 cases of tracheoesophageal puncture performed as a means of secondary voice restoration after total laryngectomy, in 70 patients proving unable to learn esophageal speech and as a treatment of choice in a further 32 cases. Complications arose in 21 cases but were generally minor and could be overcome. Results were favorable in 45 of 70 and 29 of 32 cases, respectively. The method was considered effective, particularly when supported by the patient's determination to learn a verbal communication method. "
general pathological conditions,"Pulmonary malignant angioendotheliomatosis. Presentation with fever and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. A 64-year-old man presented with protracted fever, hyponatremia, and mononeuritis multiplex. Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion was established. The absence of pulmonary infiltrates precluded any lung biopsy. Autopsy revealed malignant angioendotheliomatosis involving multiple organs including the alveolar septa and pulmonary vasculature. An early diagnosis of MAE in the setting of fever and SIADH may be possible via transbronchial biopsy. "
general pathological conditions,"Surgical presentation of Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome). Five patients with Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome) are reported whose varied presentations included acute abdominal pain, peripheral arterial aneurysms, digital gangrene and sterile pyuria and whose presenting pathology ranged from hydrops of the gallbladder to enteric pseudo-obstruction. As the complications of the disease can usually be managed without resort to surgery, which is associated with a mortality rate of up to 25 per cent, the recognition of Kawasaki disease will prevent hazardous and unnecessary laparotomy. "
general pathological conditions,"Intraventricular diamorphine via an Ommaya shunt for intractable cancer pain. We describe two patients in whom diamorphine was administered into the intraventricular space via an Ommaya reservoir, producing excellent pain relief. The use of this technique for long term administration of analgesia is reviewed. "
general pathological conditions,"Recovery of CD3+ and CD5- lymphocyte subpopulation after autologous bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy. Although most circulating T cells in normal subjects express both CD3 and CD5 antigens on the cell surface, a small number lack the CD5 antigen. Recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplants develop increased numbers of CD3+ CD5- cells, particularly those who develop graft versus host disease (GVHD). This CD3+ CD5- population may rise transiently in patients who have received an autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) and in patients following completion of intensive chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). These findings suggest that these CD3+ CD5- cells are a normal component of the regenerating lymphoid system after BMT or chemotherapy. "
general pathological conditions,"L-tryptophan use and the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. We present a case of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome in a patient taking large doses of L-tryptophan for sedation. He developed the now-classic findings of myalgias, skin changes, and marked eosinophilia. This syndrome was first recognized in late 1989, and epidemiologic studies have demonstrated an association of the clinical syndrome with ingestion of L-tryptophan. The mechanism of toxicity remains unknown. Casual use of L-tryptophan has been diminished by its rapid removal from the nutrition counter of health food stores. "
general pathological conditions,"Effect of indomethacin on pain relief after thoracotomy. The effect of indomethacin on postoperative pain was studied in 60 adult patients undergoing thoracotomy in a prospective, randomized, double-blind manner. Patients receiving indomethacin required significantly less opioid after operation and had significantly lower pain scores compared with the control group. Pain on movement and on coughing were reduced also. No major adverse effects were encountered. "
general pathological conditions,Treatment of renal cell carcinoma by extracorporeal partial nephrectomy and autotransplantation using splenic vascular anastomosis. A patient with large left lower pole renal cell carcinoma in a solitary kidney is presented. The patient was treated by partial nephrectomy and autotransplantation using splenic arterial and venous anastomoses. The potential for reducing operative morbidity compared with autotransplantation to the iliac fossa is discussed. 
general pathological conditions,"Functional heart replacement with the spindle pump: first results. The spindle pump is a nonpulsatile blood pump with a double function, i.e., it works centrifugally and represses simultaneously. The first experiences with this type of pump used as a biventricular assist device in four short-term animal experiments (up to 13 hours) are described. It can be demonstrated that in cases of a normally beating heart, this BVAD decompresses both ventricles by 60-70%, while the aortic pressure is slightly increased; on the other hand, in case of ventricular fibrillation, the BVAD with two spindle pumps maintained the entire circulation, at an arterial pressure between 80 and 90 mmHg with a flow volume between 3.5 and 4 L/min. "
general pathological conditions,"Chest pain in teenagers. When is it significant? Chest pain in teenagers often has no obvious organic cause. Onset of symptoms with an emotionally stressful situation may indicate psychogenic chest pain. The differential diagnosis also includes cardiac, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and respiratory disorders. Routine testing generally does not help to establish a diagnosis and may even do harm by reinforcing a patient's unspoken fear of serious illness. Most teenagers with chest pain have no such illness, and symptoms usually resolve without therapy. An important role for primary care physicians is to provide support during evaluation and follow-up. "
general pathological conditions,"Microvascular right-to-left pulmonary shunt demonstrated by a radionuclide method. A 37-yr-old man with angiolymphoid hyperplasia (Kimura's syndrome), who had been treated unsuccessfully for suspected asthma, was investigated due to a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation (86%). Right heart catheterization and angiography of the pulmonary artery failed to demonstrate any right-to-left shunts. However, simultaneous scintigraphy over the lungs, kidneys, and head after injection of 150 MBq technetium-99m-labeled macroaggregated albumin i.v. and inhalation of 150 MBq krypton-81m demonstrated a right-to-left shunt in the lungs probably caused by precapillary pulmonary arteriovenous shunts. "
general pathological conditions,"Recurrent renal cell carcinoma arising in Wilms' tumor. A 19-month-old black girl had a radical nephrectomy for a Wilms' tumor that contained areas of epithelium indistinguishable from renal cell carcinoma. She was treated with chemotherapy but subsequently had pulmonary metastases develop and massive abdominal recurrence. The recurrent tumor was histologically renal cell carcinoma with no identifiable Wilms' tumor elements. The child died with recurrent and metastatic tumor 13 months after nephrectomy. Pathologic, immunoperoxidase, and flow cytometric studies of this unusual case are presented. "
general pathological conditions,"Malignant potential of juvenile polyposis coli. Report of a case and review of the literature. Juvenile polyps of the colon and rectum traditionally have been viewed as being benign inflammatory or harmartomatous lesions without potential for malignant change. The authors report a case of adenocarcinoma developing in a patient with sporadic juvenile polyposis. Juvenile polyposis was diagnosed in the patient at age 4 years. He underwent subtotal colectomy at age 6 years. At age 12, he underwent a proctectomy and a Swenson pull-through because of adenomatous changes in the rectal stump. At age 19 surveillance endoscopy revealed invasive cancer in a juvenile polyp. "
general pathological conditions,"Myotonic heart disease: a clinical follow-up. We followed 37 patients with myotonic dystrophy for a mean of 6 years. Two developed atrial flutter or fibrillation, 6 developed a new bundle branch block, 1 developed complete heart block requiring a pacemaker, and another with progressive 1st-degree heart block and a widening QRS interval had a sudden death. Most patients had predictable, gradually progressive disease of their cardiac conduction system. We recommend that patients with progressive atrioventricular block or widening QRS interval due to myotonic heart disease have yearly ECGs and be questioned about syncope or presyncope to determine the need for a cardiac pacemaker. "
general pathological conditions,"Medical management of acute traumatic rupture of the aorta. Surgical reconstruction is the treatment for acute traumatic aortic rupture and should be accomplished immediately in most patients. In patients in whom concomitant injuries or the development of life-threatening complications preclude safe and successful aortic reconstruction, pharmacological intervention to reduce the risk of free aortic rupture may be considered. Surgical reconstruction can then be more safely performed under controlled elective circumstances. "
general pathological conditions,"Inflammatory nodular reactions after hepatitis B vaccination due to aluminium sensitization. In 2 patients, pruritic nodules appeared after revaccination against hepatitis B. Aluminium was found to be responsible for this side effect: contact allergy to aluminium was present in both patients, whereas controls were negative. "
general pathological conditions,"Complete jejunoileal necrosis due to torsion of the superior mesenteric artery. We have reported a case of small-bowel volvulus in which complete jejunoileal necrosis resulted from torsion of the superior mesenteric artery. This case was unusual not only because of the extent of necrosis but also because primary small-bowel volvulus is rare in adults. Despite nearly total small-bowel resection, the patient continues to do well 6 months postoperatively. "
general pathological conditions,"Secondary hypogonadism in hemochromatosis. Hemochromatosis is a rare disorder of iron storage. This report illustrates a case of hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism in a female with biopsy-proven hemochromatosis. Dynamic pituitary and gonadal testing revealed subnormal gonadotropin responses to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) but normal ovarian reserve, as shown by normal follicular stimulation with hMG. Thus, abnormalities of ovulation and menstruation in patients with hemochromatosis are most likely because of inadequate pituitary responsiveness to GnRH. "
general pathological conditions,"Adenocarcinoma arising in a foregut cyst of the mediastinum. A case of malignant transformation in a mediastinal cyst of the esophageal reduplication type is presented. The cyst had been recognized 39 years previously, but remained asymptomatic until sudden growth occurred. It was resected totally from the esophagus and the patient recovered well. A review of the literature showed that malignancy in mediastinal foregut cysts is extremely rare. "
general pathological conditions,"Congenital dermoid fistula of the lower lip. A case of congenital dermoid fistula of the lower lip is presented. The lesion consisted of a major cystic portion, a proximal tubelike extension that opened in the lower lip as a small sinus (pit) near the left commissure, and a distal cordlike extension that entered into the left mental foramen. The cystic cavity was lined with keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium, and many sebaceous glands, sweat glands, and hair follicles were seen subcutaneously. The differential diagnosis and the pathogenesis of the lesion are also discussed. "
general pathological conditions,"The epithelial changes associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva: a review of the clinical, histological and viral findings in 78 women. Seventy-eight excised specimens of squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva were reviewed retrospectively for the presence of lichen sclerosus or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) at sites proximal to the tumour or more distant. Lichen sclerosus was evident in 61% and VIN alone in 31%. VIN III (differentiated) was associated with over 50% of the specimens with lichen sclerosus. HPV 16 was found in six of the 11 VIN lesions, investigated but in none of the six with lichen sclerosus. "
general pathological conditions,"Chancroid and the role of genital ulcer disease in the spread of human retroviruses. Chancroid is the most prevalent form of genital ulcer disease in developing countries and is undergoing a resurgence in industrialized countries. As a result of a nonspecificity of the clinical findings, the etiologic diagnosis of genital ulcer disease requires laboratory support. Genital ulcer disease is a risk factor for the transmission of human retroviral infections. An understanding of this interaction is emerging and will impact on the treatment and control programs for the agents causing genital ulcer disease. "
general pathological conditions,"Recurrent acute glomerulonephritis. Biopsy-proven recurrent acute glomerulonephritis (AGN) is extremely rare and is usually seen in children with acute, well-defined streptococcal infections. We present here a patient with recurrent AGN in the absence of chronic bacterial infection. The subject, an 80-year-old man, had eight episodes of acute nephritic syndrome following upper respiratory tract infection. No abnormalities were detected during remissions. Renal biopsies during two of those episodes showed typical postinfectious acute exsudative endocapillary glomerulonephritis, while results of another biopsy performed during remission were normal. "
general pathological conditions,"Perforin-mediated myocardial damage in acute myocarditis. Endomyocardial specimens were obtained from 7 patients with acute myocarditis. Immunohistochemical examination of the mononuclear infiltrate showed mainly cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Perforin (a pore-forming protein found in cytotoxic lymphocytes) was identified in this myocardial lymphocytic infiltrate and electron microscopy showed myocardial cell damage that may have been associated with these perforin containing lymphocytes. The results indicate that in acute idiopathic and viral myocarditis, myocardial damage may be due to the action of perforin-secreting lymphocytes. "
general pathological conditions,Cystic medionecrosis of the coronary arteries and fatal coronary vasospasm. The histopathological basis of coronary vasospasm is not well defined. We report a patient with directly observed coronary artery spasm in whom cystic medionecrosis of the coronary arteries and great vessels and myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve were evident. We suggest that myxoid connective tissue lesions of the heart may be linked to coronary vasospasm. 
general pathological conditions,"Hepatic fibrin-ring granulomas in a patient with hepatitis A. Hepatic fibrin-ring granulomas were found in a 30-year-old patient with serologically confirmed hepatitis A. Other causes associated with the presence of fibrin-ring granulomas in the liver, such as Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cytomegalovirus infection, visceral leishmaniasis, and consumption of allopurinol, were ruled out. It is suggested that hepatitis A must be included in the differential diagnosis of a patient with hepatic fibrin-ring granulomas. "
general pathological conditions,Hypothalamic or central obesity is associated with an early rise in plasma insulin concentration. Insulin levels in a 7-year-old boy with hyperphagia and obesity following an episode of meningoencephalitis were studied sequentially during the course of progressive weight gain. High fasting insulin levels (1183 pmol/L) and strikingly high insulin release in response to glucose (7892 pmol/L) were found within weeks of the onset of the illness. The abnormality in insulin secretion occurred prior to the marked weight gain. Hyperinsulinemia was not accompanied by hypoglycemia. Early hyperinsulinemia may be a primary event in the development of hyperphagia and obesity following hypothalamic injury. 
general pathological conditions,"Urinary tract infection in women. Current role of single-dose therapy. Administration of a single dose of an antimicrobial agent is acceptable therapy for women with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections. There is adequate information in the literature to support the clinical use of single-dose therapy, although there is still a need for further, well-designed, sufficiently large studies that compare single-dose therapy to abbreviated-course (3-day) and traditional (7- to 14-day) therapy. "
general pathological conditions,Conservative management or closed nailing for tibial shaft fractures. A randomised prospective trial. We performed a prospective randomised trial on matched groups of patients with displaced tibial shaft fractures to compare conservative treatment with closed intramedullary nailing. The results showed conclusively that intramedullary nailing gave more rapid union with less malunion and shortening. Nailed patients had less time off work with a more predictable and rapid return to full function. We therefore consider that closed intramedullary nailing is the most efficient treatment for displaced fractures of the tibial shaft. 
general pathological conditions,"Coumadin-induced gastrointestinal hemorrhage associated with an ileal duplication. A 31-year-old man had recurrent gastrointestinal hemorrhage after aortic valve replacement and initiation of anticoagulation therapy with coumadin. Radionuclide bleeding scan and subsequent contrast angiogram demonstrated a site of hemorrhage in the distal ileum, and at surgery a 1.8-cm spherical duplication was found. On histologic examination, the duplication was lined with normal ileal mucosa, and near the mouth of the duplication an inflammatory ulceration proved to be the site of hemorrhage. In a young patient with anticoagulation-associated gastrointestinal hemorrhage, alimentary tract duplication should be considered. "
general pathological conditions,"Sarcosaprophagous fly activity in Maryland. Eighty-six successful rearings of sarcosaprophagous flies characteristic of the first successional insect wave of infestation of a corpse were conducted under field conditions in Maryland. Different species were observed to be active during spring and summer. The development times for the immature stages of each species, with the related temperatures at which the development occurred are reported for both seasons studied. "
general pathological conditions,"Miller-Fisher syndrome and pontine abnormalities on MRI: a case report. The authors report a patient with Miller-Fisher syndrome in whom MRI of the brain stem showed increased signal density on T2 sequence anterior to the fourth ventricle, on the right and the left. The authors discuss the relation between these MRI abnormalities and some clinical features of the syndrome. The authors believe that the cardinal features of Miller-Fisher syndrome are due to peripheral nervous system dysfunction, but that this does not preclude a possible central nervous system involvement. "
general pathological conditions,"Deep femoral to anterior tibial bypass after failed femoropopliteal reconstructions. Deep femoral to anterior tibial artery bypass is a reconstructive technique occasionally applicable when more conventional attempts at revascularization of the distal portion of the leg have failed. Three such patients, in whom the anterior tibial was the only distal patent branch of the popliteal artery, had severe symptoms of arterial insufficiency. Deep femoral to anterior tibial bypass was done using autogenous The distal portion of the deep femoral artery was exposed through an anteromedial distal thigh approach. The three patients have been followed up for a mean of 20.3 months, and each maintains graft patency and marked symptomatic improvement. "
general pathological conditions,"Progressive inflammatory lesions of the brain parenchyma in localized scleroderma of the head. A patient with localized scleroderma of the head, uveitis, and Raynaud's phenomenon presented with generalized seizures, spastic hemiparesis, and local IgG production in the cerebrospinal fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed progressive cortical and subcortical brain parenchymal lesions mainly adjacent to the cutaneous and bony lesions and probably of inflammatory origin. "
general pathological conditions,"Hyperadrenergic orthostatic intolerance as a result of postpartum blood loss. This article describes a young women in whom orthostatic intolerance developed as a result of protracted postpartum vaginal bleeding. The cardiovascular abnormalities were unresponsive to usual treatment measures, and she required combination therapy directed at increasing plasma volume and decreasing sympathetic nervous system activity. After resolution of her symptoms, the patient required no long-term therapy. Chronic blood loss has not been reported as a cause of this syndrome. "
general pathological conditions,"Aspiration in bilateral stroke patients. Seventy patients with bilateral strokes underwent neurologic and videofluoroscopic barium swallowing examinations; 34 (48.6%) aspirated. Patients with aspiration were more likely to have posterior circulation strokes, abnormal cough, abnormal gag, and dysphonia. However, patients likely to aspirate can be identified best by the presence of an abnormal voluntary cough, an abnormal gag reflex, or both. The prediction of patients at risk for aspiration was not improved by additional clinical information (ie, presence of dysphonia or bilateral neurologic signs). "
general pathological conditions,"The changing direction of nystagmus in acute Meniere's disease: pathophysiological implications. The direction(s) and pathophysiologic basis of nystagmus during an acute attack of Meniere's disease have been subject to much debate in the world literature. Clinical recordings from two patients whose nystagmus was captured near the very beginning of the acute vertiginous episode are presented. Previous clinical observations in Meniere's disease, experimental animal models concerned with initiation of peripheral nystagmus, and the phenomenon of recovery are discussed. "
general pathological conditions,"The Oxford knee replacement. A review from an independent centre. We present a study of 67 Oxford bicompartmental total knee replacements performed at a district general hospital. In this general orthopaedic unit, 57 of the knees (85%) had significant relief of pain with a mean flexion range of 95 degrees and a mean flexion deformity of only 9 degrees. There was a noticeable difference between osteoarthritic and rheumatoid knees. Poor results could be directly related to an avoidable postoperative complication. The results of this independent assessment may be compared favourably with the previously published series from the specialist centre at which the prosthesis was designed. "
general pathological conditions,"Hypergastrinemia, gastric endocrine cell hyperplasia, and intractable diarrhea. A patient with pernicious anemia developed severe intractable diarrhea night and day. Investigation revealed chronic atrophic gastritis and a markedly elevated level of serum gastrin. No obvious explantation for the diarrhea was found, but after antrectomy, the gastrin level returned to normal and the diarrhea subsided. Possible mechanisms for an association between diarrhea and hypergastrinemia include colonic hypermotility secondary to release of acetylcholine and inhibition of fluid and electrolyte reabsorption within the small bowel. "
general pathological conditions,"Gallium uptake in tryptophan-related pulmonary disease. We describe a patient who developed fever, fatigue, muscle weakness, dyspnea, skin rash, and eosinophilia after taking ""high doses"" of tryptophan for insomnia for two years. A gallium-67 scan revealed diffuse increased uptake in the lung and no abnormal uptake in the muscular distribution. Bronchoscopy and biopsy confirmed inflammatory reactions with infiltration by eosinophils, mast cells, and lymphocytes. CT scan showed an interstitial alveolar pattern without fibrosis. EMG demonstrated diffuse myopathy. Muscle biopsy from the right thigh showed an inflammatory myositis with eosinophilic and lymphocytic infiltrations. "
general pathological conditions,"Modified technique of Pringle's maneuver in resection of the liver. Crushing of the hepatic parenchyma with hepatic clamps to minimize blood loss during resection of the liver leads to mechanical damage of hepatocytes. Pringle's maneuver may precipitate liver failure by hepatic warm ischemia as well. Therefore, we controlled bleeding from the surface of the resection by using light compression on the hepatic parenchyma with a band while applying a hepatic arterial clamp at the hepatic hilus. This vascular control method can be done because the portal pressure is about one-tenth of the hepatic artery pressure and provides an efficient and harmless transection of the liver. "
general pathological conditions,"Umbilical cord ulceration and intestinal atresia: a new association? In three fetuses, congenital intestinal atresia was associated with linear ulcerations of the umbilical cord. In two cases, hemorrhage was seen from the cord ulcer. Both fetuses required emergency cesarean section for fetal distress and were born anemic. The third fetus was mildly hydropic, attributed to hemorrhage, and was stillborn. The mechanism of the association could not be determined. These cases suggest a risk of prenatal umbilical cord hemorrhage in infants with intestinal atresia. "
general pathological conditions,"Sciatic nerve monitoring during revision total hip arthroplasty. This study presents a simple method of intraoperative sciatic nerve monitoring during revision total hip arthroplasty (THA), utilizing intraoperative, somatosensory evoked potentials. Using this method, the sciatic nerve was protected when surgical correction of shortened limb length was necessary during revision THA. Twenty-three revision THAs were performed using intraoperative sciatic nerve monitoring. No postoperative peripheral nerve complications occurred, with an average increase of 18 mm in leg length, ranging from 6 mm to 43 mm. "
general pathological conditions,Postauricular cerebellar encephalocoele secondary to chronic suppurative otitis media and mastoid surgery. Cerebellar herniation into the mastoid through the posterior aspect of the temporal bone as a result of chronic suppurative otitis media and mastoid surgery is a rare event. A case is reported in which such a hernia presented subcutaneously behind the pinna; its repair is discussed. 
general pathological conditions,Catastrophic thrombosis of porcine aortic bioprostheses. Hemodynamically critical thrombotic stenosis of porcine bioprosthetic valves in the aortic position without thrombotic predisposition is rare. Two patients at our institution abruptly manifested thrombotic stenosis of porcine bioprosthetic valves in the aortic position within 3 months of implantation without apparent predisposing factors. Clinicians should consider this rare but catastrophic complication in the appropriate setting. 
general pathological conditions,AAEM case report #1: ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. A patient with bilateral cubital syndrome complicated by anomalous innervation is presented. The electrodiagnostic approach to patients with this neuropathy is reviewed emphasizing new developments. The interpretation of the findings in this patient centers around issues of pathophysiology and methodology. 
general pathological conditions,A detachable balloon procedure for a traumatic internal carotid-internal jugular fistula: report of a case A case of a traumatic fistula between the internal carotid artery and the internal jugular vein is reported. The fistula was treated by detachable balloon occlusion and clipping of the internal carotid artery. 
general pathological conditions,"Recurrent lateral rectus palsy in childhood. Five patients with recurrent, lateral rectus palsy in childhood, examined at the University of Iowa Hospitals over a period of 22 years, are reported. During the same period, 131 abducens nerve palsy patients, younger than 18 years of age, were evaluated. Eighteen similar patients, most single case reports, are reviewed from the literature. All reported patients, including our own, shared the following features: spontaneous recovery within 6 months in the majority of patients, ipsilateral recurrence, and painless palsy. There is female and left-sided preponderance. Etiology is undetermined. Hypotheses include viral etiology, neurovascular compression by aberrant artery, and migraine. "
general pathological conditions,Leiomyosarcoma of the larynx: emergency laryngectomy. Leiomyosarcoma of the larynx is extremely rare. A patient with respiratory obstruction due to such a tumour is presented. This was originally misdiagnosed as hysteria. The treatment of choice was an emergency laryngectomy. 
general pathological conditions,"Repeat operation for failure of antireflux procedures. The majority of patients who receive modern antireflux operations obtain substantial long-term relief of their symptoms. About 10% to 15% will have persistent or recurrent problems, some severe enough to warrant reoperation for correction. With careful symptom review, barium study, endoscopy, and manometry, the mechanism of failure becomes evident, and remedial surgical treatment may proceed. The results at reoperation are not as good as those of the primary procedure, which emphasizes the need for proper diagnosis and choice of procedure and for reliable execution of technique at the initial treatment. "
general pathological conditions,"Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss and postnatal viral labyrinthitis: a statistical comparison of temporal bone findings. Although the cause of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss remains uncertain, a viral origin has been suggested in many cases on the basis of anamnestic microbiologic and pathologic data. Twenty-two temporal bone specimens from 18 patients who during life suffered a sudden partial or complete sensorineural hearing loss were studied. On the basis of clinical data, these cases were assigned to one of three diagnostic categories, and the temporal bones were studied by light microscopy and serial section analysis. The implications of the histopathologic findings for the pathogenesis of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss are discussed. "
general pathological conditions,Intra-abdominal abscesses in Crohn's disease. We reviewed 22 patients who had intra-abdominal abscesses secondary to Crohn's disease. A total of 29 abscesses were discovered. These included superficial and deep intraperitoneal as well as pelvic and retroperitoneal abscesses. Diagnosis was aided by ultrasound and computer tomographic scanning. Barium studies continue to play an important role in delineating the extent of bowel involvement and fistulization. Treatment varied depending on the location and size of the abscess. The need for ultimate bowel resection was determined in the majority of cases by the presence of fistulization between the abscess cavity and the bowel. The terminal ileum or neoterminal ileum were almost always involved. 
general pathological conditions,Recurrent anterior dislocation of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel. Recurrent anterior dislocation of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel is reported in two patients. This was due to traumatic attenuation of the flexor carpi ulnaris retinaculum. The mechanism of injury in both patients was a fall with the shoulder abducted and the elbow acutely flexed. Both patients had relief of their neurologic symptoms following anterior submuscular transposition of the ulnar nerve. 
general pathological conditions,"Oxygen-exacerbated bleomycin pulmonary toxicity Bleomycin is an antineoplastic agent with potential for producing pulmonary toxicity, attributed in part to its free radical-promoting ability. Clinical and research experiences have suggested that the risk of bleomycin-induced pulmonary injury is increased with the administration of oxygen. We report a case in which the intraoperative administration of oxygen in the setting of previous bleomycin therapy contributed to postoperative ventilatory failure. Our patient recovered with corticosteroid therapy. Physician awareness of a potential interaction between oxygen and bleomycin may help reduce the morbidity and mortality related to bleomycin therapy. "
general pathological conditions,"Intraoperative management of severe endobronchial hemorrhage Endobronchial hemorrhage due to pulmonary artery perforation by a Swan-Ganz catheter developed during coronary artery bypass grafting while weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. After reinstitution of cardio-pulmonary bypass with pulmonary artery venting, bleeding was localized to the right lower lobe bronchus using fiberoptic bronchoscopy. A Fogarty embolectomy catheter was inflated in the bronchus to tamponade successfully only the right lower lobe. This case illustrates a method of distal bronchial blockade for maximal retention of pulmonary function and avoidance of pulmonary resection. "
general pathological conditions,"Growth abnormalities in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Growth abnormalities in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis can be divided into two groups: local and systemic. Local disorders of growth often result in increased bone length and bone age or in marked decreases in longitudinal growth due to immobilization, premature epiphyseal closure, or fusion. Common growth defects seen in the knee, hand, wrist, hip, spine, and jaw are discussed. Systemic growth delay is most commonly secondary to active disease or treatment with corticosteroids. Nutritional aspects such as decreased appetite, reduced caloric intake, metabolic caloric requirements greater than available intake, or lack of essential vitamins could be the cause for decreased weight and stature. "
general pathological conditions,Acid aspiration prophylaxis in 288 obstetric anaesthetic departments in the United Kingdom. The choice of drugs for acid aspiration prophylaxis in 288 obstetric anaesthetic departments in the United Kingdom was determined by questionnaire. The results are compared with a similar survey of anaesthetic departments 5 years ago. The prescription of sodium citrate and the H2 receptor antagonist ranitidine has superseded that of Mist. magnesium trisilicate. 
general pathological conditions,Esophageal and gastric endoscopy in critically ill patients. How can it help you? Bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract in a critically ill patient is a tough diagnostic situation. Endoscopy can help physicians determine the cause of bleeding and can also provide several therapeutic options. The authors discuss these applications of the current technology. 
general pathological conditions,"Melanocytic hyperplasia of the oral mucosa. Lesions that exhibit melanocytic hyperplasia are uncommon in the oral mucosa. They are even more rare than the various morphologic types of nevomelanocytic lesions. This article reports the clinicopathologic features of oral lesions diagnosed as lentigo simplex, junctional lentigo (""jentigo""), atypical melanocytic hyperplasia (melanoma in situ), and melanocanthoma. The proper terminology for these lesions is also discussed. "
general pathological conditions,"Extramedullary hematopoiesis involving the esophagus in myelofibrosis. In this report, we describe a case of myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia; a 53-yr-old man was splenectomized for a massively enlarged spleen in which multiple foci of myeloid metaplasia were histologically demonstrated. The patient was referred to us for endoscopic examination, following the repeated occurrence of melena. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed two active ulcerative lesions in the bulb, and only a moderate erythema in the lower third of the esophagus, which showed no varices. There was no endoscopic evidence of active or recent bleeding. Subsequent histologic examination of biopsies taken from the esophageal lesion surprisingly revealed the presence of hematopoietic tissue. "
general pathological conditions,"Complications of flaps. Flaps are susceptible to the same complications as side-to-side closures. However, as the blood supply to a flap is more precarious, the complication may have a more dire effect. This article catalogues the various acute complications with an emphasis on early recognition and management. "
general pathological conditions,"Status epilepticus in infancy and childhood. Status epilepticus implies a prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures with persistent decreased consciousness, lasting at least 30 minutes. Both convulsive and nonconvulsive forms exist, either of which may lead to death or additional neurologic deficit. Therapy involves careful supportive care plus some combination of benzodiazepines, phenytoin, or phenobarbital. The outcome depends first on the etiology and second on the rapidity with which seizures are controlled. "
general pathological conditions,"Comparison of four pulse oximeters: effects of venous occlusion and cold-induced peripheral vasoconstriction. The ability of four pulse oximeters (the Ohmeda 3700, Nellcor N100 and N200 and the Datex Oscar) to detect hypoxaemia was determined in the presence of venous obstruction and cold-induced peripheral vasoconstriction. Significant increases in detection time for hypoxaemia were found in both cases. There were no significant differences in detection time between the instruments, although the Ohmeda 3700 displayed smaller values of SaO2 under certain conditions. Peripheral vasoconstriction was induced using three differing methods which gave differing results, thus emphasizing the importance of methodology in assessments of pulse oximetry. "
general pathological conditions,"Bilateral reexpansion pulmonary edema following unilateral pleurocentesis. Acute ipsilateral pulmonary edema following reexpansion of the lung after pleurocentesis or pneumothorax is a well described entity. We report the unusual occurrence of bilateral pulmonary edema following unilateral pleurocentesis in a young male without heart disease. Various hypotheses regarding the mechanism of reexpansion pulmonary edema include increased capillary permeability due to hypoxic injury, decreased surfactant production, altered pulmonary perfusion and mechanical stretching of membranes. This case suggests that forces leading to ipsilateral reexpansion pulmonary edema also affect the contralateral lung. "
general pathological conditions,"The response of retroperitoneal fibrosis to tamoxifen. Although retroperitoneal fibrosis is uncommon and histologically benign, it is a progressive and potentially fatal tumor. As the fibroblasts proliferate, they encase and may obstruct important retroperitoneal structures. Medical therapy in the past has been ineffectual, and since the tumor usually cannot be resected, surgery consists of lysis or bypass of the involved structures. Tamoxifen is effective in the treatment of desmoid tumors, and we report its use in two patients with retroperitoneal fibrosis with excellent results. The simplicity and safety of this treatment make tamoxifen an attractive choice of therapy. "
general pathological conditions,"Persistent carcinoma in situ of the testis after chemotherapy for advanced testicular germ cell tumours. The chemosensitivity of testicular carcinoma in situ (CIS) was analysed in 25 testes excised 10 weeks to 4.5 years following platinum-based chemotherapy. CIS was present in 8 of the 23 evaluable cases (35%), in 5 of which the lesion coexisted with invasive germ cell tumour. It is concluded that CIS may persist or recur after chemotherapy. This has implications for occult presentation of metastatic germ cell tumours and also for the management of the contralateral testis in patients with testicular germ cell tumours. "
general pathological conditions,"Nevus flammeus. Discordance in monozygotic twins. Nevus flammeus has been described as an inherited vascular anomaly. We report two cases of nevus flammeus, each appearing in one of two monozygotic twins. This finding supports the idea that nevus flammeus results from embryologic mishap rather than genetic transmission. "
general pathological conditions,"Early facial reanimation following radical parotid and temporal bone tumor resections. A retrospective study of 35 patients who underwent early facial reanimation following extirpative parotid and temporal bone surgery requiring facial nerve sacrifice was performed. Regional facial reanimation performed immediately or within several days included 16 patients who underwent temporalis muscle transposition and 27 who underwent gold weight or eyespring lid reanimation with lower lid tightening. Simultaneous nerve grafts or nerve crossover procedures were performed in 22 patients. The authors' favored approaches to facial reanimation are discussed, with an emphasis on the value of early reanimation using properly selected techniques. "
general pathological conditions,"Mitral valve prolapse. When is it serious? Mitral valve prolapse can best be diagnosed with careful clinical evaluation, including dynamic auscultation. Treatment consists of reassurance, pharmacotherapy for troublesome symptoms, and careful monitoring for signs of complications. Most complications can be either prevented or treated. "
general pathological conditions,Coronary angioplasty requiring extraordinarily high balloon inflation pressure. Two cases are presented in which extraordinarily high balloon inflation pressures (20 and 17 atm) were required to successfully dilate a saphenous vein graft stenosis and a right coronary artery stenosis. The clinical application of high balloon inflation pressures and balloon selection is discussed. 
general pathological conditions,"Paralytic shellfish poisoning--Massachusetts and Alaska, 1990 [published erratum appears in MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 1991 Apr 12;40(14):242] Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a foodborne illness caused by consumption of shellfish or broth from cooked shellfish that contain either concentrated saxitoxin, an alkaloid neurotoxin, or related compounds. This report summarizes outbreaks of PSP that occurred in Massachusetts and Alaska in June 1990. "
general pathological conditions,"Rectourethral fistula caused by Kaposi's sarcoma. A 35-year-old man with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related complex was evaluated for a persistent urethral discharge, pneumaturia and watery diarrhea. Radiographic and endoscopic procedures established the diagnosis of a rectourethral fistula. Perineal exploration and excision of the fistula revealed the pathological diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma. The differential diagnosis of an acquired rectourethral fistula and the significance of Kaposi's sarcoma are discussed. "
general pathological conditions,"Prolapse of a neovagina created by self-dilatation. In patients with congenital absence of the vagina, a neovagina may be created by either operative or nonoperative techniques. A 25-year-old patient with a neovagina created by self-dilatation developed complete prolapse of the neovagina with an enterocele. A transabdominal sacral colpopexy successfully suspended the vaginal vault and allowed the patient to resume sexual function. "
general pathological conditions,"Patient compliance--a factor in facial trauma repair. The clinical records of 25 consecutive patients who were treated for facial trauma were reviewed and analyzed to ascertain what effect patient cooperation had on the outcome of facial fracture repair. The study was designed to establish the incidence of complications and to discover what factors contributed to untoward sequela in such patients. Overall, 15 patients (60%) were noncompliant in one or more aspects of their care. Six patients (24%) had significant postoperative complications associated with their facial injuries. Four of these patients were not fully cooperative. "
general pathological conditions,"Spermatic cord for onlay coverage of urethral defect. Segmental urethral necrosis may accompany scrotoperineal gangrene, and primary closure of the urethral defect may unacceptably reduce urethral dimensions. This dilemma has been managed successfully in 5 patients by application of the intact spermatic cord to the urethral defect and approximation to its margins. A representative case is described. "
general pathological conditions,"Cochlear implant flap complications. In a series of 52 patients who received cochlear implants, 4 patients suffered flap complications (7.7%). The problems encountered involved the postauricular flap and were usually minor in nature. None required explantation as a direct result of these complications. Flap ischemia in a patient with Cogan's syndrome and vasculitis, two cases of suture extrusion with one having exposure of the implant, and a case of receiver unit magnet extrusion repaired with a vascularized pericranial flap based upon temporalis muscle are presented. Flap design in patients who have had postauricular incisions demands special consideration. Principles useful for avoiding complications as well as their management are discussed. "
general pathological conditions,"Microangiopathy in the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. The eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with the ingestion of L-tryptophan was recognized in late 1989. We describe our pathologic study of skin, fascial, and muscle biopsies from 21 patients evaluated by light microscopy, histochemistry, and electron microscopy. A perivascular, lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils was present in the dermis, fascia, and skeletal muscle. Lymphocytic infiltration of arteries and arterioles was seen. Ultrastructurally, capillary and arteriolar endothelial cell thickening and necrosis was present. This microangiopathy suggests that ischemia may be a contributing factor to the findings in this syndrome. "
general pathological conditions,"Bone weakness after the removal of plates and screws. Cortical atrophy or screw holes? Bone weakness leading to refracture is a recognised complication of the removal of rigid fixation plates. We have used partially demineralised rabbit tibiae to simulate atrophic changes and to determine whether weakness is due to atrophy or to residual screw holes. Partial demineralisation and a screw hole each reduced maximum bending moment. However, energy absorbing capacity was little affected by demineralisation, but was reduced to 50% by a single drill hole. Residual screw holes are a considerably more important cause of bone weakness after plate removal than is cortical atrophy. "
general pathological conditions,"Skin blisters as a manifestation of oxazepam toxicity. A 75 year-old comatous patient was admitted after ingestion of 200 mg oxazepam. Skin blisters, attributed to oxazepam toxicity, appeared on the left forearm the following day and regressed spontaneously nine days later. "
general pathological conditions,"Comparative yield of Salmonella typhi from blood and bone marrow cultures in patients with fever of unknown origin. Over three years, a comparative study on 100 selected patients with fever of unknown origin was undertaken to determine the yield of Salmonella typhi from their blood and bone marrow cultures. The results indicate that in patients who had an infection with S typhi the organism was isolated from the bone marrow in all of them and from the blood in only 66%. This suggests that bone marrow cultures may be attempted when blood cultures are negative for bacterial growth after three to four days of incubation. "
general pathological conditions,"Resolution of inferior vena cava syndrome after embolization of a hepatic adenoma. A 77-year-old man presented with severe pruritus and massive lower body edema. Computerized axial tomography of the abdomen showed a large hepatic mass compressing the inferior vena cava, and a liver biopsy specimen showed hepatic adenoma. Embolization of vessels feeding the hepatic tumor resulted in complete resolution of pruritus and ascites, and clinical remission has persisted for 1 year following partial obliteration of tumor vasculature. Angiographic ablation of tumor blood supply represents a nonoperative means for inducing clinical remission in patients with symptomatic hepatic adenoma who are at high surgical risk. "
general pathological conditions,"Acute pain relief. Pain is a multidimensional psychophysiologic phenomenon. Systematic multidimensional assessment is an essential first component of an effective plan to relieve the pain. Nurses are key to effective pain management because of the close, 24-hour-a-day relationship with the hospitalized patient. It is the nurse who is most critical to the adequate assessment of pain, to the implementation of the treatment plan, and to the evaluation of efficacy. Nurses should continue to develop a better knowledge base about pain and pain therapies and assessment skills, be assertive in obtaining effective treatment for their patients, and perceive themselves as responsible for pain relief. "
general pathological conditions,"Repeat hepatic resection for primary and metastatic carcinoma of the liver. During the last 15 years, 19 patients underwent repeated hepatic resections for malignant lesions of the liver. The first hepatic resection had been performed four to 40 months earlier for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (nine patients) or hepatic metastases (ten patients), eight of which were of colorectal origin. Repeat resection was an extensive hepatectomy in six, a segmentectomy in six and a local excision in seven. In one patient, three wedge resections and, finally, hepatic transplantation were subsequently performed after an initial extended right lobectomy. The operative mortality rate was 5.2 per cent. The three year actuarial survival rate was 64 per cent after the second resection. "
general pathological conditions,"The prophylactic use of octreotide in a patient with ovarian carcinoid and valvular heart disease. This case report describes the use of octreotide, a long-acting somatostatin analogue, in the management of a patient with an ovarian carcinoid tumour and severe cardiac valvular disease. This patient underwent laparotomy and tumour resection without complication. Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam, fentanyl, and vecuronium, and maintained with isoflurane as well as additional fentanyl and vecuronium. However, we feel that it was the use of octreotide that prevented a life-threatening crisis intraoperatively, and recommend its use in patients with carcinoid syndrome undergoing anaesthesia and surgery. "
general pathological conditions,Intradural herniation of a thoracic disc presenting as flaccid paraplegia: case report. A case of intradural herniation of a thoracic disc in a patient with a flaccid paraplegia is described. Intradural herniation of a thoracic disc is considered a rare event. A review of the relevant patient literature revealed 14 other reports involving 28 patients. No other report has described a patient with an intradural thoracic disc herniation who developed a flaccid paraplegia. 
general pathological conditions,"Ear involvement in the yellow nail syndrome. Recognized features of the yellow nail syndrome include yellow nails, lymphedema, and pleural effusions. We report a patient with the additional feature of keratosis obturans, which may be a manifestation of this syndrome in the external ear. "
general pathological conditions,"Two urogenital sinus syndromes. Interstitial cystitis and focal vulvitis. Forty-six young women had unusual and presumably noninfectious disorders of unknown etiology involving tissues derived from the embryonic urogenital sinus (urogenital sinus syndromes). Ten women had interstitial cystitis, and 25 had focal vulvitis. Eleven women had both interstitial cystitis and focal vulvitis. The affected groups were similar in demographic and other characteristics. Most were white and in their mid-20s. Both unusual conditions occurred in the same woman more often than could be expected by chance. This observation suggests that some common, perhaps autoimmune mechanism may be involved in the etiology of these syndromes. "
general pathological conditions,"Fatigue failure of noncemented porous-coated implants. A retrieval study. The causes of mechanical failure of five noncemented porous-coated components were studied. There were two cobalt-chromium alloy and three titanium alloy implants which fractured after 12 to 48 months. The implants included one acetabular component, and one femoral condylar, one patellar and two tibial components. Examination of the fractured surfaces revealed fatigue to be the mechanism of failure in all cases. The porous coating and the processes required for its fabrication had resulted in weakening and reduction of substrate thickness. Additional factors were stress concentration due to limited, localised bone ingrowth, and some features of the design of the implants. "
general pathological conditions,Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections of the skin. Report of fourteen cases and review of the literature. This study comprised 14 patients from whose skin nontuberculous mycobacteria were recovered. Most clinical manifestations were relatively nonspecific. Various histopathologic patterns were observed in 22 biopsy specimens. Recurrences were common and prolonged treatment was often necessary. Culture of tissue remains the definitive diagnostic procedure. Cutaneous lesions can be the first or only site of nontuberculous mycobacteriosis. 
general pathological conditions,"Papular-purpuric ""gloves and socks"" syndrome. We report five cases of an acute, self-limiting dermatosis that has not been previously described. It consists of a pruritic edema and erythema of the hands and feet in a gloves-and-socks distribution and is associated with oral lesions and fever. The clinical course is characterized by the rapid development of petechial purpura and clearing of lesions within 1 to 2 weeks. The disease appears to affect only young and otherwise healthy persons and occurs mostly during the spring. The etiology is unknown but might be of infectious origin. "
general pathological conditions,Postoperative sore throat: topical hydrocortisone Forty patients undergoing tracheal intubation and controlled ventilation of the lungs for elective surgical procedures were studied. They were allocated randomly into one of two groups. The tracheal tubes used for group A patients were lubricated before insertion with water-soluble 1% hydrocortisone cream. Those for group B patients were lubricated with KY jelly. The incidence of postoperative sore throat was found to be significantly greater in group A. Topical 1% hydrocortisone cream is therefore ineffective in the prevention of postoperative sore throat. 
general pathological conditions,Tethered cord syndrome from a choristoma of mullerian origin. Case report. The authors report a case of tethered cord syndrome due to a choristoma of mullerian origin located in the spinal cord at the lumbosacral junction. Two similar cases were found upon review of the literature. The embryology of this lesion is discussed. 
general pathological conditions,"The management of atypical non-cardiac chest pain. Atypical, non-cardiac chest pain is common and disabling, and often persists despite negative medical investigations. Aetiology is disputed and management is difficult. A multi-causal model in which both psychological and physical factors play a part is helpful; a fundamental factor is continued misinterpretation of minor physical symptoms as evidence of heart disease. We report supportive evidence and describe a psychological treatment derived from the model. In a randomized trial, cognitive behavioural methods were effective in reducing chest pain, disability and use of medication, in patients both with and without psychiatric disorder. The clinical implications are discussed. "
general pathological conditions,Myelopathy presenting decades after surgery for congenital cervical cutaneous lesions. We report on two patients in whom cervical myelopathy developed decades after they had undergone surgery for congenital cervical cutaneous lesions. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated dorsal tethering and cavitation of the cervical cord in the area of the previous surgery and was helpful in decision making regarding surgical exploration and in planning for it. We stress the importance of long-term follow-up by both clinical examination and magnetic resonance imaging in children who have been operated on for cervical cutaneous masses that may have central connections. 
general pathological conditions,"Site of action of continuous extrapleural intercostal nerve block. Continuous extrapleural intercostal nerve block has been shown in a randomized, controlled study to be effective in reducing postoperative pain after thoracotomy and in restoring pulmonary mechanics. To assess the extent of spread of bupivacaine infused through an extrapleurally placed cannula inserted at thoracotomy, iohexol (Omnipaque) was infused at 5 days postoperatively in 5 patients and computed tomography performed. The contrast medium was confined to the paravertebral space covering on average six intercostal spaces. This study demonstrated that anatomically, the site of action of the bupivacaine infused through an extrapleural cannula was primarily in the paravertebral space. "
general pathological conditions,A case of unilateral posterior ischemic optic neuropathy after radical neck dissection. We present a case of unilateral posterior ischemic optic neuropathy after bilateral radical neck dissection. Etiologic factors are discussed. 
general pathological conditions,Multiple myeloma and bullous lichenoid lesions: an unusual association. Many associations of lichenoid reactions have been described but this case appears to be a previously unreported association--with multiple myeloma. This case also demonstrates the necessity of a mucosal biopsy with adequate hematologic and serologic investigations to obtain a definitive diagnosis. 
general pathological conditions,"Localised endosteal bone lysis in relation to the femoral components of cemented total hip arthroplasties. Four cases are described of localised endosteal bone lysis in the femur occurring in association with cemented femoral components that were not obviously 'loose' radiologically. In each, the area of lysis was shown at operation to be related directly to a region in which there was a local defect in the cement mantle surrounding the stem. Via the space between the stem and cement, such defects provide a route through which the contents of the joint cavity may reach the endosteal surface of the femur, subsequently leading to localised bone lysis, and later to frank loosening. "
general pathological conditions,"Rounded atelectasis complicated by obstructive pneumonia and pulmonary arterial thrombosis [published erratum appears in Chest 1991 Jun;99(6):1556] A patient with a history of asbestos exposure developed rounded atelectasis. The mass was associated with local bronchial obstruction, obstructive pneumonia and arterial thrombosis. Autopsy demonstrated marked pleural thickening and radiographically inapparent asbestosis. This is the first reported case in which seemingly benign rounded atelectasis not only increased morbidity, but also contributed to mortality through airway obstruction and local arterial thrombosis. "
general pathological conditions,The efficacy of azathioprine in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. We randomized 59 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis to receive azathioprine (AZA) 3.0 mg/kg daily or placebo in a double-masked therapeutic trial. Analysis of data for predetermined primary outcome measures demonstrated a significant difference favoring AZA for observed mean exacerbation rate after 2 years of therapy and time to deterioration in both Ambulation Index and Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale score. This study confirms a modest therapeutic benefit for azathioprine previously reported by other investigators. 
general pathological conditions,"An eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with an L-tryptophan containing product. A syndrome of eosinophilia and myalgias associated with the usage of L-tryptophan containing products has been recently described by the Centers for Disease Control. We report a case of this new clinical entity, highlighted by severe myositis, and compare this illness with similar reported syndromes. "
general pathological conditions,"Surgical aspects of malaria. The spread of drug-resistant organisms and increased international travel makes malaria a disorder of ever-increasing importance. This report reviews those aspects of malaria of surgical relevance. The importance of the spleen in host defence against malaria and other infections makes splenic preservation desirable whenever possible after rupture of the spleen. Tropical splenomegaly is caused by an abnormal immune response to malaria and is best managed medically. Careful selection of blood donors is essential to prevent transfusion malaria, and routine antimalarial prophylaxis is indicated for blood recipients in many endemic areas. The risk of postoperative malaria may justify chemoprophylaxis in certain patients. "
general pathological conditions,Right hemothorax: an unusual presentation of ruptured aortic dissection. This report presents the case of a 55-year-old male with rupture of a descending thoracic aortic dissection into the right hemithorax who successfully underwent prosthetic graft replacement of the involved segment of the aorta through left thoracotomy. 
general pathological conditions,Treatment of Fournier's gangrene with adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Fournier's gangrene is a devastating infection and often is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Surgical debridement and antibiotics are the cornerstones of therapy. This case describes the use of hyperbaric oxygen as an adjunct in the treatment of Fournier's gangrene. 
general pathological conditions,Endophthalmitis after removal of an encircling band. A case of endophthalmitis following the removal of an encircling band is presented. A possible route of entry in the absence of scleral perforation during the procedure is proposed. 
general pathological conditions,"Pathologic bronchial vasculature in a case of massive hemoptysis due to chronic bronchitis. The cause of bleeding in a patient with recurrent massive hemoptysis was not apparent after bronchoscopy and gross examination of the lobectomy specimen. Histologic submission of all major bronchi uncovered dilated, tortuous bronchial arteries just below the bronchial mucosa with sites of both current and healing arterial rupture. This bronchial arterial abnormality is common to several chronic pulmonary diseases, but is rarely diagnosed as a cause of massive hemoptysis. Careful pathologic examination of major bronchi in the setting of hemoptysis of unknown causation is recommended. "
general pathological conditions,"Intravascular ultrasound imaging of an acute dissecting aortic aneurysm: a case report. A case of acute dissecting aortic aneurysm is described in which intravascular ultrasonography was used at the time of aortography to produce real-time, 360 degree cross-sectional images of the aorta. The transmural vessel morphology visualized by this new catheter-based technology allowed confirmation of the diagnosis and identification of distal extension to the aortic bifurcation. The case demonstrates the unique potential of this modality in diagnosis and possible therapy in vascular diseases. "
general pathological conditions,Right pulmonary artery obstruction after pulmonary artery banding. Serial assessment of pulmonary artery flow by Doppler echocardiography was carried out in 15 infants after pulmonary artery banding. Three infants were identified as having branch pulmonary artery obstruction based on diastolic pulmonary artery flow. It is concluded that this flow profile may be specific for branch pulmonary artery obstruction after pulmonary artery banding. 
general pathological conditions,"Transient mitral regurgitation due to mitral valve prolapse accompanied by systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. A grade 4/6 systolic murmur, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM), and severe mitral regurgitation (MR) documented by two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography developed suddenly on the structurally normal heart of a patient with idiopathic portal hypertension. The patient did not have signs of congestive heart failure and the aforementioned phenomenon disappeared completely when the patient was in hepatic failure. This could be explained by a change in circulating blood volume either by gastrointestinal hemorrhage or hepatic failure. "
general pathological conditions,"Urinary tract dilatation in pregnancy. Right-sided ureteral and renal pelvis dilatation was observed during routine uterine ultrasonographic examination at 30 weeks' gestation. This continued to progress with the renal pelvis measuring 8.9 cm in diameter at 35 weeks, leading to early delivery. Renal function remained normal and these changes resolved completely after delivery. "
general pathological conditions,"Periurethral colonic-type polyp simulating urethral caruncle. A case report. A 50-year-old, black woman presented with a 1-cm, polypoid lesion on the posterior edge of the urethral meatus that had the gross appearance of a urethral caruncle. The histologic features, however, revealed a superficially ulcerated lesion composed of colonic-type mucosal glands with focal regenerative atypia in response to inflammation. A similar histologic pattern is also found in so-called solitary rectal ulcer syndrome and inflammatory cloacogenic polyps arising in the anorectal area. Based upon an English-language literature review, this case appears to be the second reported one of an intestinal-type polyp in this location. The patient had no further problems after excisional biopsy. "
general pathological conditions,"Spontaneous infarction of placental chorioangioma and associated regression of hydrops fetalis. We report a case of a large chorioangioma diagnosed prenatally with concomitant meconium peritonitis and hydrops fetalis in the second trimester. Spontaneous regression of the tumor occurred, associated with some resolution of the fetal hydrops and delivery near term with good neonatal outcome. "
general pathological conditions,"The osteogenetic potential of fracture haematoma. Subperiosteal and intramuscular transplantation of the haematoma. We studied the precise role of the fracture haematoma in healing by the experimental transplantation of the haematoma at two days and four days after fracture of the rat femur to subperiosteal and intramuscular sites. We used bone marrow and peripheral blood haematomas for control experiments. The transplanted two-day fracture haematoma produced new bone by endochondral ossification at the subperiosteal site, but not at the intramuscular site. Four-day fracture haematoma produced new bone formation at both subperiosteal and intramuscular sites. These results suggest that fracture haematoma has an inherent osteogenetic potential. "
general pathological conditions,"Possible mechanisms limiting N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor overactivation and the therapeutic efficacy of N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists. Cytotoxic overactivation of neuronal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors is postulated to contribute to the pathogenesis of neuronal loss in hypoxia-ischemia. However, several events associated with hypoxia-ischemia may limit N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated injury. Perhaps the most important of these events is the development of extracellular acidosis. These limiting events may help explain why N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors contribute to injury more in focal ischemia or hypoxia in vitro than in global ischemia. "
general pathological conditions,"Hypothalamic obesity due to hydrocephalus caused by aqueductal stenosis. A case is presented of 14 year old female with hypothalamic obesity due to hydrocephalus caused by aqueductal stenosis. Evidence of hypothalamic obesity included 1) acute hyperphagia and weight gain, 2) neuroradiology showed hydrocephalus with focal enlargement of the third ventricle, 3) endocrinological studies revealed hyperinsulinaemia and impaired growth hormone (GH) response to arginine, but normal GH response to growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF) and 4) Torkildsen's ventriculo-cisternal shunting resulted in improvement in hyperphagia and obesity. "
general pathological conditions,Bilateral Norrie's disease in identical twins. A case of Norrie's disease in an identical twins is reported. No positive family history was obtained. The couple had no other children. The older of the twins died at the age of 9 months of uncertain cause. To the best of my knowledge this is the first case of Norrie's disease reported in Malaysia. And its occurrence in an identical twins is very rare. 
general pathological conditions,Job's syndrome: a rare cause of recurrent lung abscess in childhood. A clinical syndrome characterized by recurrent staphylococcal infection of the skin and respiratory tract from birth was described in 1966 and referred to as Job's syndrome. Marked hyperimmunoglobulinemia E was later found to be associated with this syndrome. This article describes a case of Job's syndrome as a cause of recurrent lung abscess during childhood necessitating lung resection. 
general pathological conditions,"In vitro and in vivo consequences of VLA-2 expression on rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Cloned integrin alpha 2 subunit complementary DNA was expressed on human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells to give a functional VLA-2 (alpha 2 beta 1) adhesion receptor. The VLA-2-positive RDA2 cells not only showed increased adhesion to collagen and laminin in vitro, but also formed substantially more metastatic tumor colonies in nude mice after either intravenous or subcutaneous injection. These results show that a specific adhesion receptor (VLA-2) can markedly enhance both experimental and spontaneous metastasis. In contrast to the metastasis results, there was no difference in either the in vitro growth rate or apparent in vivo tumorigenicity of RD and RDA2 cells. "
general pathological conditions,"Scalp necrosis in a neonate treated with cultured autologous keratinocytes. A neonate compromised by a stressful labor, low birth weight, anemia, seizures, and enterocolitis developed necrosis of a caput succedaneum of the calvaria. Coverage with cultured autologous keratinocytes was successful and represents a treatment modality with minimal morbidity compared with conventional split-thickness skin grafts. "
general pathological conditions,"Cortical asymmetry of REM sleep EEG following unilateral pontine hemorrhage. A 24-year-old woman with a left pontine hematoma showed marked asymmetry in the EEG of REM sleep, suggesting that a unilateral pontine lesion is sufficient to disrupt normal REM sleep EEG in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Other REM sleep characteristics (rapid eye movements, muscle atonia) were unaffected by this lesion. "
general pathological conditions,"Isolated muscular sarcoidosis causing fever of unknown origin: the value of gallium-67 imaging. An unusual case of a patient with a long-standing fever of unknown origin (FUO) is presented whose gallium-67 (67Ga) images revealed increased activity only in the calf muscles bilaterally. Other imaging modalities also failed to show chest or other abnormal findings. Subsequent biopsy of the right gastrocnemius muscle revealed noncaseating granulomas consistent with the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. When using 67Ga to evaluate a patient with a FUO, imaging of the extremities should always be included. Also, when abnormal Ga-67 uptake is present in the extremities, sarcoidosis should be included in the differential diagnosis. "
general pathological conditions,Colon cancer in pregnancy with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level at presentation. A case of colon cancer in pregnancy is presented in which the maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level was elevated. Failure to evaluate colon cancer as a cause of the elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein may have accounted for the poor outcome. 
general pathological conditions,"Gallium-67 imaging in retroperitoneal fibrosis: significance of a negative result. A patient with retroperitoneal fibrosis and right peritracheal and hilar lymphadenopathy was studied using gallium-67-citrate. No abnormal uptake was seen in the regions of retroperitoneal fibrosis, while there was avid uptake in chest lesions later shown to represent small cell lung carcinoma. Retroperitoneal fibrosis which does not show gallium uptake is most likely mature, with few inflammatory elements. In patients with multiple retroperitoneal and/or mediastinal masses, gallium imaging may be useful in identifying the most active sites of disease for possible biopsy and for subsequent monitoring of response to therapy. "
general pathological conditions,"Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (L-tryptophan-associated neuromyopathy). Histopathologic study of skeletal muscle biopsy in a patient with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome following L-tryptophan use showed prominent lymphocytic perineuritis, neuritis, and perimysial fasciitis. The presence of perineuritis and neuritis provides a histopathologic basis for clinical features of neuropathy in eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and occurred in conjunction with a fasciitis or interstitial myositis that was predominantly perimysial and focally endomysial. "
general pathological conditions,Intussusception encephalopathy: an underrecognized cause of coma in children. Intestinal intussusception is a common cause of bowel obstruction in infancy and early childhood. Typically the presenting signs and symptoms are referable to the abdomen. On occasion the most prominent presenting feature is depressed level of consciousness. We describe 3 patients who presented with coma associated with intussusception. 
general pathological conditions,"Recurrent transient ischemic attacks and stroke in association with an internal carotid artery web Fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic vascular disease that most commonly affects cervical carotid arteries at the C1-C2 level when cephalic arteries are involved. Several histopathologic and angiographic subtypes of fibromuscular dysplasia exist; most have a benign natural history. We describe the third reported case of a pathologically proven, symptomatic proximal internal carotid artery web and suggest that patients with this lesion are at a higher risk for stroke. "
general pathological conditions,Klinefelter's syndrome with anomalous origin of left main coronary artery Klinefelter's syndrome is a rare entity. Even rarer is an anomalous origin of the Left Main Coronary Artery. For both conditions to occur in the same patient is hence exceedingly rare. Reported here is a never previously reported case of a coronary congenital anomaly in a patient with Klinefelter's syndrome together with the proper angiographic approach. 
general pathological conditions,"Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis in two neutropenic patients. Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis is an uncommon, self-limited dermatosis with a variable clinical presentation. It seems to be due to chemotherapeutic drugs in most cases. Necrosis of the eccrine gland associated with a neutrophilic infiltrate is the histologic hallmark of this disease. We report two additional cases in neutropenic patients with acute myelogenous leukemia in which there was a striking lack of neutrophil infiltration. A new term, drug-associated eccrine hidradenitis, is suggested. "
general pathological conditions,"Percutaneous pedestal in cochlear implantation. Direct electrical connection between an external sound-processing device and intracochlear electrodes is accomplished via a percutaneous pedestal. Patient pedestal complaints and experience have been recorded. Pedestal problems have been classified into six classes, with class 0 indicating no problems and the severity of problem increasing in classes 1 through 4. Class 5 indicates pedestal trauma. No class 5 problems were encountered. At 48 months of experience, 53% of patients were class 0 and 26% were class 1. The pedestal experience is detailed in the paper. The percutaneous pedestal has been found to be a well-tolerated, efficient system for information transfer in cochlear implant patients. "
general pathological conditions,"Successful treatment of recurrent corneal erosion with Nd:YAG anterior stromal puncture I used a new technique to create anterior corneal stromal punctures for the treatment of traumatic recurrent corneal erosions that had not responded to conventional therapy. Three patients with such erosions within the visual axis were successfully treated by using multiple applications of the Nd: YAG laser set at energy levels between 1.8 and 2.2 mJ. One of these patients had previous stromal puncture with a bent 25-gauge needle. The erosions of all patients healed without complications and have remained symptom-free for four to six months. Compared with needle puncture, the laser punctures were more reproducible, shallow, and translucent. "
general pathological conditions,"Ventricular ectopy: significance and management. Ventricular ectopy is a normal variant of cardiac rhythm, and its significance in an individual is related to cardiac risk factors and the presence or absence of heart disease. Although there is good evidence in many forms of heart disease that complex VEBs indicate a high risk of death, treatment of asymptomatic VEBs with antiarrhythmic drugs has not been shown to improve survival and may be hazardous. Treatment should be directed at the underlying heart disease. Those with heart disease and severe symptoms resulting from VEBs will often require electrophysiological assessment as to specific antiarrhythmic therapy. Those without heart disease can usually be managed by reassurance and do not require antiarrhythmic drugs. "
general pathological conditions,"Carotid-cavernous sinus fistula associated with a primitive trigeminal artery. Carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas are not rare, but they have never been reported in association with persistent primitive trigeminal artery. We recently encountered such a case. The Jaeger-Hamby procedure was employed, with mandatory occlusion of the primitive trigeminal artery. "
general pathological conditions,"A rare case of renovascular hypertension due to iatrogenic thoracoabdominal aortic dissection. A report of successful surgical treatment in childhood. Renovascular hypertension due to iatrogenic thoracoabdominal aortic dissection in an 8-year-old girl with aortic valvular stenosis is presented. A splenorenal arterial anastomosis without splenectomy was successfully performed. This procedure is considered best suited for children with thoracoabdominal aortic dissection as the autogenous graft is expected to grow and provide long-term patency. The spleen left in situ was expected to be advantageous, from the immunological aspect, at the time of open heart surgery for aortic valvular stenosis, which was anticipated in the near future in this child. "
general pathological conditions,Anaesthetic management of a 2-month-old infant for laser resection of vocal cord granuloma. A 2-month-old infant underwent excision of granulomata of vocal cords with a carbon dioxide laser. High frequency jet ventilation was given through a surgical metal suction tube during the operation. The anaesthetic technique for the infant and the problems of the use of carbon dioxide laser in laryngeal surgery are discussed. 
general pathological conditions,"Pathogenesis and treatment of intra-abdominal infection. Intra-abdominal infection is considered potentially life-threatening. Such infection is frequently secondary to perforated viscera, trauma or inflammatory disease. Simple abscesses may be drained percutaneously with roentgenologic guidance; complex abscesses often require open surgical drainage. Secondary peritonitis is usually polymicrobial; broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy effective against aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, as well as gram-positive organisms, is essential. Newer antibiotics, administered either singly or in combination, have been used successfully to treat intra-abdominal infection while avoiding the toxicity of aminoglycosides. "
general pathological conditions,"Acute myeloid leukemia and background radiation in an expanded case-referent study. A case-referent study that investigated possible associations between environmental and occupational exposures and acute myeloid leukemia was performed on 86 cases and 172 referents, all of whom were living. Exposure information was obtained through a questionnaire mailed to each subject. An association was found between time spent in concrete buildings at home and work and leukemia morbidity. In addition, extensive x-ray examinations that occurred more than 5 y prior to diagnosis were more common among cases than referents. "
general pathological conditions,"'Locked-in syndrome' for 27 years following a viral illness: clinical and pathologic findings. We describe a man who, after a presumed encephalitic illness, was ""locked-in"" for 27 years. His CT and autopsy findings showed atrophy of the brainstem and a cystic lesion at the base of the pons. He survived longer than most other patients in a similar state. "
general pathological conditions,Photic sneeze reflex in nephropathic cystinosis Photic induced sneeze is a reflex that occurs in certain individuals after exposure to bright light. Cystinosis is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism in which nonprotein cystine accumulates within lysosomes. The pathognomonic ocular manifestation of cystinosis is corneal crystal deposition. We observed photic induced sneezes during ophthalmoscopic examination in five of 19 patients with nephropathic cystinosis (26%). We report on this observation and discuss possible pathophysiological mechanisms for photic induced sneezing in cystinosis. 
general pathological conditions,"Rebleeding from intracranial dissecting aneurysm in the vertebral artery. We describe two patients with rebleeding from intracranial vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms during the acute stage. One patient had excellent results after emergency surgery. A review of recent reports including 60 patients with this disorder revealed a rebleeding rate of 30%, mostly during the acute stage. This suggests that a ruptured dissecting aneurysm in the vertebral artery is at risk for rebleeding during the acute stage, similar to a saccular aneurysm in the same location. "
general pathological conditions,"Recurrent rhabdomyolysis in association with cocaine use. As the popularity of cocaine increases in our society, so does the frequency and variety of medical complications associated with its use. A growing number of cases have implicated cocaine use in the development of rhabdomyolysis and its complication, acute renal failure. We have reported the first case of recurrent rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure directly associated with cocaine use. Although adulterants might cause muscle damage, we believe cocaine should be added to the list of drugs that are capable of producing rhabdomyolysis. "
general pathological conditions,"Cytogenetic analysis of a granulocytic sarcoma in a patient without systemic leukaemia. Granulocytic sarcoma is a rare complication of leukaemia. Occasionally it presents before the development of systemic leukaemia when diagnosis may be difficult. A case of granulocytic sarcoma occurring in a patient with no overt evidence of leukaemia, but in whom cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow showed a clonal t(12;13) translocation, is reported. Cytogenetic analysis of tissues in this disease may indicate evidence of systemic disease before overt morphological changes. "
general pathological conditions,Bronchobiliary fistula detected by cholescintigraphy. We present a case of a bronchobiliary fistula initially detected by hepatobiliary scintigraphy. The patient developed bilioptysis 18 mo after undergoing a right hepatic lobectomy and resection of the common bile duct for cholangiocarcinoma. The procedure was complicated by the development of a subphrenic abscess that required percutaneous biliary drainage. 
general pathological conditions,"Salicylate poisoning from enteric-coated aspirin. Delayed absorption may complicate management. Acute salicylate poisoning with enteric-coated aspirin may result from accidental ingestion, a suicide attempt, or a complication of long-term therapy. Because absorption of enteric-coated aspirin is delayed, use of the Done nomogram to determine toxicity may lead to underestimating the severity of the poisoning. Treatment options include induction of emesis or diuresis, gastric lavage, administration of activated charcoal, and surgery. "
general pathological conditions,"Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome with splenosis. A case report. This is the first reported case of simultaneously occurring pelvic splenosis and Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome. No other congenital or anatomic abnormalities were observed in the patient, and she had no history of abdominal trauma or surgery. Endometriosis was suspected initially during laparoscopy for pelvic pain. After tissue removal at laparotomy, the histologic evaluation established the diagnosis of splenosis. Biopsy at laparoscopy should be considered to confirm the diagnosis in the presence of a congenital anomaly and lesions suspected of being endometriotic. "
general pathological conditions,"Sex reversal syndrome (XX male). Men who appear normal and live a normal life, may have a 46,XX karyotype and present with the typical features of infertility and end organ (testicular) failure. They are azoospermic and their small testicles show specific patterns on light and electron microscopy. Recent advances in genetics (1) favor the ""X-Y interchange"" theory to explain this phenomenon; (2) hypothesize about the roles of the H-Y antigen and testis determining factor (TDF) in determining ""maleness""; and (3) allow mapping of the relative positions of H-Y and TDF loci on the Y chromosome. "
general pathological conditions,"Caseating hepatic granulomas in Hodgkin's lymphoma. A 68-year-old man presented with recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma after a 9-year disease-free interval induced by chemotherapy. In addition to histological evidence of recurrent Hodgkin's disease, the liver biopsy specimen showed extensive caseating granulomas. Cultures of bone marrow and liver tissue tested negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. No antituberculous treatment was administered, and the patient had an excellent clinical response to additional chemotherapy for lymphoma. Hodgkin's lymphoma should be added to the list of disease entities associated with caseating granulomas in the liver. "
general pathological conditions,"Ocular complications of rheumatic diseases of childhood. The association between inflammatory ocular and articular disease is a strong one, although the pathogenesis of this relationship is obscure. For the physician or surgeon caring for children with chronic arthritis, awareness of the risk of chronic asymptomatic anterior uveitis is essential if early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of visual impairment are to be accomplished. This is particularly true for children with pauciarticular-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis. Acute symptomatic anterior uveitis is characteristic of disorders such as ankylosing spondylitis. Whereas this disease is initially more unpleasant for the child, it has a good long-term prognosis. "
general pathological conditions,"Giant breast hematoma requiring blood transfusion: an unusual complication after an echocardiographic study during thrombolytic therapy. We report on a patient in whom significant bleeding occurred during thrombolytic therapy. The bleeding occurred after an echocardiographic study, and it resulted in blood transfusion. "
general pathological conditions,"Use of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of cortical blindness in pregnancy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be helpful in the assessment of eclampsia and preeclampsia with central nervous system symptomatology such as cortical blindness. We describe a rare case of complete binocular blindness postpartum with no other neurologic deficits, in which MRI abnormalities were undetected on computed tomography. The better soft-tissue discrimination of MRI may visualize important but subtle lesions which ultimately may help to explain the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism in such cases. "
general pathological conditions,Ampullary hamartoma: endoscopic diagnosis and treatment. This study shows a patient who presented with intermittent biliary tract obstruction caused by ampullary hamartoma. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed a large ulcerated papilla and dilated biliary ducts. Tissue diagnosis was established by a large particle biopsy obtained with a snare. The patient underwent a successful endoscopic sphincterotomy and has remained symptom free for 4 years. 
general pathological conditions,"Tension pneumothorax secondary to a gastropleural fistula in a traumatic diaphragmatic hernia. We report a case of tension pneumothorax due to a gastropleural fistula resulting from perforation of the stomach in a traumatic diaphragmatic hernia. Awareness of perforation of strangulated stomach or bowel in a diaphragmatic hernia as a cause of pneumothorax, with or without tension physiology, in a patient with a history of trauma is important so that surgical repair can be undertaken without delay. "
general pathological conditions,Delayed facial palsy following uncomplicated stapedectomy. We report six cases of partial lower motor neurone facial palsy occurring between four and ten days after uncomplicated stapedectomy. The aetiology is unclear but recovery was rapid and complete in all patients. 
general pathological conditions,"Thalidomide: treatment of severe recurrent aphthous stomatitis in patients with AIDS. An increasing number of AIDS patients have been noted to suffer severe recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), a condition often associated with high morbidity that remains unresponsive to conventional therapeutic interventions. In two cases thalidomide was administered to successfully treat AIDS patients with RAS. Both patients experienced complete abatement of pain shortly after therapy was initiated. Ulcerations that were present for months resolved after three or four weeks of thalidomide therapy without any adverse effects. Thalidomide appears to be an effective agent for the treatment of severe RAS unresponsive to traditional therapies. "
general pathological conditions,"A surgical approach to the cervicothoracic spine. We describe a method for approaching the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine, the brachial plexus and related vessels. The method involves the elevation of the medial corner of the manubrium, the sternoclavicular joint, and the medial half of the clavicle on a pedicle of the sternomastoid muscle. We have used this exposure in 17 cases with few complications and good results. Its successful performance requires high standards of anaesthesia, surgical technique and postoperative care. "
general pathological conditions,"Spinal anaesthesia in day-care surgery with a 26-gauge needle. We studied 106 day-care surgical patients (52 male) aged 18-70 yr (mean 49.6 yr) who received spinal anaesthesia with a 26-gauge spinal needle. The incidence of headache, back pain and patient acceptability were investigated after operation using a questionnaire. The incidence of postspinal headache was 7.5%, and 11.3% of patients developed back pain. One patient remained in hospital because of hypotension and dizziness. There were no major complications and patient acceptability was almost 100%. We conclude that spinal anaesthesia for day-care surgery is easy to perform and cost effective. "
general pathological conditions,Possible role of leukotrienes in gastritis associated with Campylobacter pylori. This study was done to evaluate the role of leukotrienes (LTs) in gastritis associated with Campylobacter pylori. Biopsy specimens of gastric mucosa were obtained endoscopically from 18 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia for bacteriological and histological examination and extraction of LTs. There was correlation between the LTB4 level in the mucosa and the degree of gastritis evaluated histologically. The level was higher when infiltration of neutrophils in the gastric mucosa was more extensive. The LTB4 level in mucosa infected with C. pylori was higher than that in noninfected mucosa. These findings suggest that endogenous LTs may be related to the pathogenesis of gastritis associated with C. pylori. 
general pathological conditions,"Reoperation for recurrent peptic ulcer disease. The patient with recurrent peptic ulcer evidences failure of an initial operation to control the ulcer diathesis. A trial of aggressive medical therapy is warranted in elective presentations and has a moderate chance of success. Failing this, we believe that reoperation should be tailored to the patient's physiologic status and previous operation (Table 5). Nevertheless, in most cases, we believe that the second operation should be the final operation and should consist of the procedure with the lowest recurrence rates. Therefore, we believe that the assurance of an adequate antrectomy and complete vagal section is the preferred procedure for most patients with recurrent peptic ulcer. "
general pathological conditions,"Peritoneal blastomycosis. Blastomycosis is a systemic fungal infection caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis. Involvement of the peritoneum is unusual, with only two previously reported cases that occurred in association with disseminated disease. A single case of histopathologically proven blastomycosis involving the peritoneum is presented, as well as a short overview of previously published cases on gastrointestinal and peritoneal blastomycosis. The case is unique in that chronic peritonitis was the only manifestation of disease. The diagnosis was made by laparoscopy. "
general pathological conditions,"Fast short-tau inversion-recovery MR imaging. To enhance the versatility of the short-tau inversion-recovery (STIR) sequences, the authors determined a range of repetition time (TR) and inversion time (TI) combinations that suppress signal intensity from fat by study of both patient and phantom images. To make fast STIR images, variations in the following pulsing conditions were studied with use of an interactive computer program: decreasing the TR, limiting the number of excitations, and limiting the number of phase-encoding steps. The authors found that (a) STIR imaging need not be time consuming, (b) fat suppression can be accomplished at shorter TR by using shorter TI, and (c) short-TR fast STIR imaging is sensitive to enhancement with gadopentetate dimeglumine. "
general pathological conditions,"Scatter photocoagulation restores tissue hypoxia in experimental vasoproliferative microangiopathy in miniature pigs. Experimental retinal branch vein occlusion using argon laser photocoagulation in miniature pigs induced the development of ischemic retinal territories associated with preretinal neovascularization. Preretinal partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) measurements on the ischemic territories, using O2-sensitive microelectrodes, established that the ischemic retinal areas were hypoxic. Scatter photocoagulation of these ischemic hypoxic territories restores the local PO2 to the normal values within 2 weeks. Hence, the reported inhibitory effect of photocoagulation on the development of retinal neovascularization could be due to a reversal effect on tissue hypoxia. "
general pathological conditions,"Discontinuation of neuroleptic medication in older, outpatient schizophrenics. A placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Thirty-five schizophrenic outpatients over the age of 52 who had been stable on neuroleptic medication were all switched to haloperidol. Ten patients were unable to tolerate the haloperidol and two dropped out of the study. The remaining 23 patients were randomly and blindly assigned to haloperidol or placebo and then followed for 6 months. Five patients did not complete the study due to medical or administrative reasons. Among the patients who completed the study, five of 10 randomized to placebo relapsed compared with only one of eight randomized to haloperidol. However, three of 10 patients randomized to placebo have remained stable without medication for 2.5 years. "
general pathological conditions,"Nitrous oxide antagonizes CNS stimulation by laudanosine in mice. We have investigated whether nitrous oxide antagonizes or augments the CNS stimulant action of laudanosine in mice by comparing the mean convulsive doses (CD50 (SE] of a control group and those following pretreatment with 65% nitrous oxide in oxygen for 20 and 180 min. Nitrous oxide significantly increased CD50 from 46.8 (1.4) mg kg-1 of control to 57.3 (1.3) mg kg-1 at 20 min and 53.5 (1.7) mg kg-1 at 180 min. The attenuation of the effect of nitrous oxide at 180 min, suggestive of possible partial drug tolerance, was not statistically significant. These findings indicate that nitrous oxide antagonizes the CNS stimulating action of laudanosine. "
general pathological conditions,"Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Recognition of a distinct clinicopathologic entity The eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome is a newly described disorder related to the ingestion of L-tryptophan-containing products. Its presentation may mimic other disorders characterized by eosinophilia and muscle pain and/or weakness, but can be differentiated by certain characteristic laboratory and pathologic findings. We report two such cases, describe their features, and review similar syndromes. "
general pathological conditions,"Reinforcement of incontinent stools in the treatment of encopresis. In this paper, fecal incontinence and constipation were treated in two mentally retarded individuals using a novel intervention wherein incontinent stools were first rewarded in order to increase the frequency of bowel movements. This intervention was implemented only after more traditional pediatric and behavioral treatments were unsuccessful. The reinforcement of incontinent stools procedure resulted in an increase in both the frequency and the number of continent stools for both individuals. Hypotheses regarding the failure of previous treatments and the success of the current treatment are discussed as well as directions for future research. "
general pathological conditions,"Ulcerative colitis and giant cell arteritis associated with sensorineural deafness Sensorineural deafness is rarely associated with both ulcerative colitis and giant cell arteritis. A patient is described in whom acute sensorineural deafness occurred in association with episcleritis, ulcerative colitis and clinical features suggesting giant cell arteritis. "
general pathological conditions,Severe hemorrhagic radiation proctitis advancing to gradual cessation with hyperbaric oxygen. We report a case of a male patient suffering from a severe hemorrhagic radiation proctitis which gradually ceased with hyperbaric oxygen. We discuss the mechanisms of chronic radiation injury and the effect of the hyperbaric oxygen. This therapy is proposed as an alternative to surgical intervention for this abnormality. 
general pathological conditions,"Management of low-risk metastatic gestational trophoblastic tumors. The clinical course of 48 patients with low-risk metastatic gestational trophoblastic tumors (GTTs) treated with primary single-agent chemotherapy was reviewed. All patients achieved sustained remission, although 25 (51%) required a second single-agent regimen, and 7 (14%) needed combination chemotherapy to achieve it. An average of 3.4 courses of chemotherapy were necessary to achieve remission, and 6 patients (12%) underwent resection of resistant tumor foci. Primary single-agent chemotherapy is a reasonable treatment option in patients with low-risk metastatic GTT. "
general pathological conditions,"An angiographic technique for three-dimensional determination of arterial supply patterns in cadaver soft tissue. A method for arterial tree mapping that can be used in cadaver soft tissue is presented. In situ angiograms and photographs are supplemented with profile angiograms of relatively narrow bands of tissue from the removed specimen. The described method was better suited for mapping the course and supply patterns of a soft-tissue arterial network than either in situ angiograms or dissection. While practical problems were encountered with most of the solutions used for providing radiopacity or structural support to the vessels, pure barium sulfate was found to be suitable because it filled the vascular tree to the capillary level without leakage during excision of the specimen. "
general pathological conditions,"Heart weights of white men 20 to 39 years of age. An analysis of 218 autopsy cases. Review of autopsy data for 218 white men between 20 and 39 years of age who died of injuries or suddenly and unexpectedly indicated a mean heart weight of 371 g. The mean for those dying of external causes was 364 g whereas the mean for those dying of natural causes was 446 g. A coefficient for heart weight expressed as a percentage of body weight was lower in heavy individuals than lightweight individuals; it ranged between 0.38% and 0.55%, with a mean of 0.48%. Heart weight, including epicardial fat, increased with age and body weight. These data may be useful to those who are called upon to investigate sudden and unexpected deaths. "
general pathological conditions,"Late rupture of a superior intercostal artery following repair of aortic coarctation. Having had surgical repair of aortic coarctation at the age of 12 years, and re-operation at the age of 19 years for stenosis at the site of the previous repair, a 29 years old man presented as an emergency with a 24 hour history of interscapular pain, haemoptysis and collapse. At thoracotomy he was found to have a ruptured superior intercostal artery which was ligated. Spontaneous rupture of an intercostal artery has not been previously recorded. "
general pathological conditions,"Patients with mental disorders who work. Mental illness can devastate persons intellectually and emotionally; with maintenance therapy, however, certain patients with chronic mental illnesses are capable of holding a variety of jobs. From the total population of psychiatric patients in our VA outpatient clinic, the 87 who were gainfully employed were identified to determine common factors among them. Affective disorders were the predominant diagnoses among patients who worked, while schizophrenia was more common among those who did not. Alcoholism was diagnosed in approximately 25% of working and nonworking groups. "
general pathological conditions,"Long-term efficacy of primary laser trabeculoplasty. Sixty glaucomatous eyes of 60 patients treated with laser trabeculoplasty as primary therapy were reviewed retrospectively. There were 42 eyes with capsular glaucoma and 18 with simple glaucoma. The mean prelaser intraocular pressure (IOP) was 35.2 (SD = 6.5) mmHg. Success was defined as IOP less than or equal to 22 mmHg without medication. The probability of success was 0.73 at 1 year, 0.66 at 2 years, 0.57 at 3 years, and 0.50 at 4 years. Three eyes experienced progressive visual field loss or disc damage in spite of an intraocular pressure below 22 mmHg without medication. High prelaser pressure and the severity of the visual field defects were significant predictors of treatment failure. "
general pathological conditions,Dexamethasone as an adjunct in oropharyngeal obstruction in a patient with leukemia. Incipient airway obstruction due to fulminating bacterial infection of pharyngeal tissues requires prompt and definitive intervention. A case is presented in which dexamethasone was a key adjunct to antibiotic therapy in averting this problem in a severely neutropenic patient with acute leukemia. 
general pathological conditions,"Electrocardiographic J waves after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. A patient was monitored prior to, during, and after cardiac arrest with a Holter monitor and an electrocardiograph. The arrest occurred without any premonitory signs on the ECG. At the onset of the arrest, torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia occurred, which quickly degenerated into ventricular fibrillation. After a successful second defibrillation, the patient developed Osborn waves, which subsided within a few minutes. "
general pathological conditions,"Percutaneous puncture of a nondeflatable coronary artery angioplasty balloon. We report a case in which a balloon catheter became permanently inflated in a coronary artery saphenous vein bypass graft. While still inflated, the balloon was forcibly withdrawn from the graft into the external iliac artery and successfully deflated via percutaneous puncture using a CHIBA needle. "
general pathological conditions,"Locked intramedullary fixation for metaphyseal malunion and nonunion. Locked intramedullary rod fixation, established for metaphyseal fractures, is applicable to reconstructive procedures. Fourteen cases of complex nonunion or malunion (five infected) were reviewed retrospectively. Thirteen of the 14 fractures united. Eleven of 14 required an open procedure for removal of metal, soft-tissue release, bone grafting, osteotomy, or resection of infected bone. Infections were controlled by resection, depot antibiotics, and early stabilization. Interlocking intramedullary rods are an excellent fixation technique for posttraumatic metaphyseal reconstructive procedures. "
general pathological conditions,"Granulomatous sialadenitis. Granulomatous inflammation in salivary tissues is most often a response to liberated ductal contents, particularly mucin, in various degrees of obstructive sialadenopathy. Far less often is a granulomatous sialadenitis the result of specific infective granulomas or systemic granuloma-forming diseases. In these instances, the salivary parenchymal involvement is usually secondary to disease localization in regional lymph nodes. "
general pathological conditions,"Deletion of Alu sequences in the fifth c-sis intron in individuals with meningiomas. An abnormality in the c-sis protooncogene was identified in leukocyte DNA from members of a family predisposed to the development of meningioma, and was found to be associated with the development of the tumor in those individuals. Molecular analysis of this abnormality demonstrated a deletion within the fifth intron of the c-sis gene. The normal c-sis gene has an Alu sequence in this region which includes two perfect 130 nucleotide repeated sequences separated by 5 bp. The deleted c-sis allele is missing precisely one copy of the 130 bp repeat and the intervening 5 bp. An identical deletion was also found in DNA from 1 of 13 sporadic meningiomas. "
general pathological conditions,Coracoclavicular screw fixation for unstable fractures of the distal clavicle. A report of five cases. Five consecutive unstable fractures of the distal third of the clavicle were treated by indirect open reduction and internal fixation using a temporary Bosworth-type screw. Coracoclavicular fixation provided and maintained reduction of the fracture. Healing occurred uneventfully within nine weeks in all cases. The screw was removed under local anaesthesia after healing of the fracture and there were no surgical complications. Shoulder function was restored to the pre-injury level. Temporary coracoclavicular screw fixation appears to be a valuable alternative for the treatment of type II fractures of the distal third of the clavicle. 
general pathological conditions,"Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and anaphylactoid reactions to high-flux membrane dialysis In a retrospective study, 9 of 236 haemodialysis patients treated with high-flux polyacrylonitrile 'AN 69' membranes were found to have had anaphylactoid reactions. Treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors had been recently started in all 9 affected patients; only 5 of 227 unaffected patients had been treated with ACE inhibitors, and anaphylactoid reactions disappeared after discontinuation of ACE inhibitors. "
general pathological conditions,"Capsular genu syndrome. We report 5 patients with unilateral infarct and 1 with hemorrhage limited to the genu of the internal capsule. The most prominent finding was contralateral facial and lingual hemiparesis with dysarthria. Three patients also showed unilateral mastication-palatal-pharyngeal weakness, and 1 had unilateral vocal cord paresis. Mild limb involvement was limited to hand weakness in 4 patients. Our findings suggest that the majority of motor corticopontine and corticocobulbar fibers are located in the genu of the internal capsule. The faciolingual syndrome and its variants are highly suggestive of capsular genu stroke. "
general pathological conditions,Squamous carcinoma metastatic to the sternum. A 63-year-old man had a 10 x 16-cm sternal mass 18 months after a second aortocoronary bypass operation. The resected lesion was a metastatic tumor of squamous histology. No primary tumor was found. The diagnostic work-up and treatment options are presented. 
general pathological conditions,"Stiff-man syndrome: a GABAergic autoimmune disorder with autoantigenic heterogeneity. Autoantibodies that reacted with cell bodies and axon terminals of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons were present in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid in a patient with stiff-man syndrome with type I diabetes. Immunoblot experiments using this patient's serum and cerebrospinal fluid did not corroborate an earlier observation that these autoantibodies are directed against the GABAergic cytosolic enzyme, L-glutamic acid decarboxylase. While L-glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies may be associated with this syndrome, they do not appear to be easily demonstrated. "
general pathological conditions,Emphysematous pyelonephritis: surgical implications. Emphysematous pyelonephritis in patients with diabetes mellitus is increasingly recognised as a disease requiring urgent and aggressive treatment. We present 3 cases of emphysematous pyelonephritis; 1 patient required percutaneous nephrostomy followed by nephroureterectomy but the other 2 were successfully managed with antibiotics and control of diabetes. Diagnosis was confirmed by sequential imaging techniques which demonstrated an inflammatory renal mass associated with gas and fluid. 
general pathological conditions,"Primary peritoneal sarcoidosis. A 14-year-old male was admitted for the evaluation of tense exudative ascites. Despite thorough evaluation, the diagnosis remained cryptic until peritoneoscopy revealed diffuse studding of the entire visualized peritoneum with multiple miliary nodules, and peritoneal biopsy demonstrated multiple noncaseating epithelioid granulomas. After other causes were excluded, a diagnosis of sarcoidosis was considered and confirmed with classic endobronchial findings at bronchoscopy. Involvement of the peritoneum with sarcoidosis is rare and, to our knowledge, only one other case describes this as the initial manifestation of this disease. "
general pathological conditions,Subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a fungal aneurysm of the vertebral artery as a complication of intracranial aneurysm clipping. Case report. Intracranial aneurysms are an uncommon manifestation of fungal infection. A case is described in which the formation of an aneurysm followed an intracranial intraoperative Aspergillus infection attributable to a long period of preoperative antibiotic medication and immunosuppressive therapy with steroids. 
general pathological conditions,"A possible role for antiphospholipid antibodies in acquired cardiac valve deformity. We studied the frequency of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in patients undergoing cardiac valve replacement, and present the results in the context of the pathology of the valve lesions. Forty-eight consecutive patients undergoing valve replacement were studied. Of the whole group, 15 (31%) had antibody levels greater than 2 SD above the mean for a control group of healthy persons and 11 (23%) had a level of greater than 3 SD. There was an increased frequency of elevated antibody levels in patients with valves showing fibrocalcific change and a significant association between aPL and valve thrombus. The possible role of these antibodies in the pathogenesis of the valve lesions is discussed. "
general pathological conditions,"Meropenem pharmacokinetics and penetration into an inflammatory exudate. The pharmacokinetics and penetration into a cantharidine-induced inflammatory exudate of meropenem was studied in six volunteers following a single 1-g intravenous dose. Concentrations in plasma, urine, and the inflammatory exudate were determined by a microbiological assay. The mean elimination half-life of meropenem in plasma was 1.1 h, with the concentration in plasma declining from a mean of 23.6 micrograms/ml at 1 h to 0.7 micrograms/ml at 6 h. The inflammatory fluid penetration was rapid (time to maximum concentration of drug in serum, 0.75 h), and the penetration was 111%. The recovery of meropenem in urine at 24 h was 65.4% of the administered dose. "
general pathological conditions,"A method for performing full-thickness, orthotopic, penetrating keratoplasty in the mouse. In an attempt to overcome the lack of well characterized, inbred, and congenic strains, as well as a paucity of immunological reagents, in rabbit and rat models, we have developed a procedure for performing full-thickness, penetrating keratoplasty in the mouse. One hundred percent of isografts (BALB/c onto BALB/c) were successful, while 83.3% of allografts (C3H onto BALB/c) failed. The use of a mouse model to study corneal graft failure will allow a critical evaluation of the role of a variety of immunological mediators in causing graft failure. "
general pathological conditions,"Pathological changes in levator palpebrae superioris muscle treated with botulinum toxin in a case of carotico-cavernous fistula. We describe the case of a patient with carotico-cavernous fistula who had botulinum toxin A to induce a protective ptosis 4.5 days before death. The levator palpebrae superioris muscle from both sides and the superior rectus muscle from the injected side were obtained for examination. The preserved samples were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, Martius scarlet blue, Glees, S100, dehydrogenase, ATPase, and toluidine blue as well as being examined by electron microscopy. Inflammation and oedema were found that were probably due to the carotico-cavernous fistula. Axonal and some myelin sheath damage were also seen. "
general pathological conditions,"The painful shoulder: Part II. Intrinsic disorders and impingement syndrome. Intrinsic disorders that can cause shoulder pain include arthritis, gout, pseudogout and osteonecrosis. In its mildest form, impingement syndrome may cause only minimal discomfort. At its worst, impingement syndrome may lead to rotator cuff tear. Bicipital tendinitis and rupture of the biceps tendon may also be associated with impingement. Early rehabilitative intervention is important. Physical therapy is directed toward restoring range of motion and muscle strength. "
general pathological conditions,"Death by smothering and its investigation. This case report provides details from an extensive death investigation, the results of which led to the certification of suicidal manner of death by means of smothering in a pillow, without additional assistance from other persons or mechanical devices. This was the death of a chronically mentally ill person who was under currently approved professional treatment. Major investigative aspects of this case were the death-scene observations of the body, elimination of the possibility of homicide, and the study and analysis of the subject's psychiatric illness. Reasons for the uncommonness of reported deaths in this category are discussed. "
general pathological conditions,"DNA ploidy pattern in rectal carcinoid tumors. The nuclear DNA pattern of 22 rectal carcinoids was determined by cytophotometry of paraffin embedded tissues. The results were compared with clinical as well as histopathologic features of the tumor. Three of the carcinoids with synchronous or metachronous metastasis had aneuploid DNA pattern, whereas 19 tumors with no metastasis showed diploid DNA pattern. No other single clinical or pathologic feature of the tumor could predict more accurately the malignant potential and the subsequent course of the rectal carcinoid. It is concluded that DNA aneuploidy in rectal carcinoid tumors is not so rare as indicated by earlier studies and that it is a factor of significant prognostic value. "
general pathological conditions,"Cerebral falciparum malaria mimicking thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. We have described a patient with cerebral falciparum malaria who had rapidly progressive CNS deterioration, renal failure, hemolytic anemia associated with striking and varied erythrocyte morphologic changes, and thrombocytopenia. The initial diagnosis was thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) of unknown origin. Reexamination of the peripheral smear of this comatose patient led to correct diagnosis and effective treatment in this case of cerebral falciparum malaria--another of medicine's great mimickers. "
general pathological conditions,"Closure of a bronchopleural fistula with bronchoscopic instillation of tetracycline. Persistent bronchopleural fistulas (BPF) due to infection, trauma, or thoracic surgical procedures are often difficult to manage. We report a patient with fulminant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia complicated by chronic BPF formation which prevented weaning from mechanical ventilation due to severe air leak. Fistula closure was obtained by instillation of tetracycline into the fistula via a fiberoptic bronchoscope using a balloon catheter and blood clot occlusion technique. This closed the BPF and allowed successful weaning from mechanical ventilation. "
general pathological conditions,Skin manifestations in congenital deficiency of leucocyte-adherence glycoproteins (CDLG). In congenital deficiency of leucocyte-adherence glycoproteins (CDLG) there is an immunodeficiency with impaired leucocyte function and cutaneous and extracutaneous infections occur. In more than 30% of cases the condition has a fatal course. We report the skin manifestations of three siblings with CDLG in which areas of skin necrosis occurred that resembled pyoderma gangrenosum. 
general pathological conditions,"Radiographic identification by mastoid sinus and arterial pattern. A skull and some incomplete postcranial remains were discovered in two searches over a two-month period near Santa Fe, New Mexico. The discoveries could be demonstrated to be from the same person, and the remains were shown to be consistent with a specific missing person on the basis of anthropological analysis. Further work led to a positive identification on multiple grounds, including agreement of the details of the mastoid sinus and endocranial arterial patterns observed radiographically. These features may be useful for establishing positive identification from skeletal remains when antemortem radiographic studies for comparison are limited to lateral cranial vault studies. "
general pathological conditions,"Laparoscopic ventrosuspensions. A review of 72 cases. Laparoscopic ventrosuspension is simple to perform after diagnostic laparoscopy. Serious postoperative complication is unlikely. However, patient follow-up over 6 months has not confirmed the usefulness of laparoscopic ventrosuspension in the management of deep dyspareunia or pelvic pain in association with a retroverted uterus. The success rate of laparoscopic ventrosuspension at 6 months varies from 18.6% to 46.5%. The prior use of a Hodge pessary does not predict the success of laparoscopic ventrosuspension. "
general pathological conditions,"Acquired childhood aphasia. Outcome 1 year after onset. The effects of the variables age at onset, cause, severity and bilaterality of lesion, and type of aphasia on course and outcome were investigated in a group of 28 aphasic children. Analysis of spontaneous speech and tests of auditory verbal comprehension were used to determine the presence of aphasia. The severity of the cerebral lesion was assessed using a rating scale for computed tomographic scans. Most of the children had not recovered completely 1 year after onset. Recovery was significantly different according to etiological categories. Complete recovery was seen in the majority of traumatic cases. "
general pathological conditions,"Acute arsenical myopathy: morphological description. We describe the histological findings of the muscle in a case of acute voluntary massive arsenic intoxication resulting in severe rhabdomyolysis. The main features on muscle biopsy were perifascicular hypercontracted fibers, myofibrillar disruption, mitochondrial abnormalities and abundant cytoplasmic vacuoles containing lipids. "
general pathological conditions,A dentofacial deformity associated with incontinentia pigmenti: report of a case. A case of IP in a 16-year-old girl has been presented. This patient manifested classic ectodermal and mesodermal anomalies. We present this case to illustrate a rare etiologic factor in the development of dentofacial deformities that can be treated in the conventional manner. 
general pathological conditions,Orbital inflammatory disease associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Orbital inflammatory disease in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus is rare and presents a diagnostic dilemma as well as a therapeutic challenge. Ours appears to be the sixth such case reported in the literature. 
general pathological conditions,Acute oculogyric crisis after administration of prochlorperazine. We report a case of acute oculogyric crisis due to prochlorperazine administration in a young black woman with a concomitant viral infection. Neuroleptic medications are the most common cause of drug-induced acute dystonic reactions such as oculogyric crisis. Prochlorperazine is an antiemetic agent with a phenothiazine-type chemical structure and is known to cause dystonic reactions. Drug-induced acute dystonic reactions are most common in young adults and in men. Viral infections may also predispose patients to these adverse reactions. Caution is warranted when this drug is used in patients who have other risk factors for an acute dystonic reaction. 
general pathological conditions,"Coronary angioplasty following cardiac transplantation: a case report and review of the literature. A 23-year-old man underwent successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of a severe stenosis of the left anterior descending artery 25 months after orthotopic heart transplantation. Four months later restenosis of the same lesion was treated by repeat PTCA. Angiography 11 months later showed no restenosis. In selected cases, PTCA may be useful in treating allograft coronary disease. "
general pathological conditions,"Cardiac tamponade and contralateral hemothorax after subclavian vein catheterization. A patient developed life-threatening cardiac tamponade and contralateral hemothorax after insertion of a subclavian catheter in the operating room. Contrast was infused through the catheter, demonstrating its malposition in the pericardial space. Contrast infusion was valuable in evaluating this complication of central line placement. "
general pathological conditions,Pressure-curve variations after trabeculectomy for chronic primary open-angle glaucoma. We report the results of a 5-year study of the influence of trabeculectomy on the maximum intraocular pressure (IOP) and the amplitude of its diurnal oscillation in 26 eyes (14 patients) with open-angle glaucoma. Pressure-curves were recorded before surgery and at 1 year and 5 years after surgery. The latter two pressure-curves demonstrated that trabeculectomy significantly reduced both the maximum IOP and the amplitude of the oscillations below preoperative values. 
general pathological conditions,"Chest infection following head and neck surgery: a pilot study. This paper reports the results of a pilot study which examined factors associated with chest infection following head and neck surgery. The overall rate of chest infection was 11%, but was 20% in those patients having a tracheotomy. No infection developed in patients with an intact airway. Other factors which emerged as possibly important were the duration of surgery and heavy regular alcohol intake. We recommend that prophylactic antibiotics be continued for at least 48 h in patients requiring a tracheotomy as part of their head and neck surgery. This is against the trend of shorter antibiotic regimens recommended for prevention of wound infections. "
general pathological conditions,"The scimitar syndrome. The clinical spectrum of the scimitar syndrome ranges from severely ill infants to asymptomatic adults. The true incidence of the disorder is unknown because the syndrome may remain undetected in asymptomatic patients until a chest roentgenogram is obtained. We have presented the contrasting clinical experiences of two adult women, one with few symptoms and a benign course, and the other with exacerbation of her asthma from recurrent upper respiratory tract infections originating in the lower lobe of her right lung. Improvement resulted from surgical resection of this congenitally abnormal, bronchiectatic segment of lung. "
general pathological conditions,"Arteriovenous malformation of the tongue. Polyvinyl alcohol particles used to embolize an arteriovenous malformation of the tongue were only temporarily successful. Additional embolization therapy was necessary and was complicated by ischemic ulcers of the tongue. We conclude that embolization therapy can be used, but the efficacy of this therapy in the longer term remains to be determined. "
general pathological conditions,"Fetal death due to nonlethal maternal carbon monoxide poisoning. Fetal death due to acute carbon monoxide poisoning is rarely reported in the medical literature. Of the eight cases found in literature review, only one documented the fetal carboxyhemoglobin concentration. This paper reports a fetal death due to accidental nonlethal maternal carbon monoxide intoxication in which both maternal and fetal carboxyhemoglobin concentrations were obtained. The corrected carboxyhemoglobin concentration was 61% at the time of death in utero, while the maternal carboxyhemoglobin was measured at 7% after one hour of supplemental oxygen. The authors review the mechanisms of fetal death and emphasize the different carbon monoxide kinetics in the fetal circulation. "
general pathological conditions,"Apparent reduction in the size of one side of the face associated with a small retrosplenial haemorrhage. A 68 year old Japanese female with unilateral metamorphopsia of the face that developed after a small haemorrhage in the contralateral retrosplenial region, is described. The patient claimed that the right side of a face, that is, the left side when looked at by the patient, appeared smaller than the left. In addition, her drawings of the face showed some distortions. Objects other than the face were perceived normally. Cranial CT scan revealed a small high density area in the right retrosplenial region. The face appears to have a special representation in the posterior hemisphere. "
general pathological conditions,"Optimal wound closure after tethered cord correction. Technical note. A technique of wound closure following tethered cord correction is presented that significantly reduces the incidence of cerebrospinal fluid collections in the subcutaneous space. In over 60 cases, the described method of fascia and skin closure has lessened wound problems to a minimal level. Patient hospitalization time has also been greatly diminished. "
general pathological conditions,Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in hypertensive crises in pregnancy. Twenty-four patients first seen with hypertensive crises during pregnancy were studied by continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for a period of 24 hours to detect the presence of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Three patients were excluded from analysis because of low serum potassium levels. Thirteen of the remaining 21 patients had ventricular tachycardia on subsequent analysis of the electrocardiogram. These arrhythmias subsided after induction of anesthesia when blood pressure control was optimal. This finding may be implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary edema and sudden death in these patients. 
general pathological conditions,"Use of the calcium agonist BAY K 8644 for in vitro diagnosis of susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia. We have studied the effects of the calcium agonist BAY K 8644 on the in vitro halothane test in 10 malignant hyperthermia-susceptible (MHS), 12 MH ""equivocal"" to halothane (MHEh), 30 MH non-susceptible (MHN) and 10 control patients. BAY K 8644 potentiated the halothane-induced contracture in muscle strips from both MHS and MHEh patients. The drug produced a more obvious difference in contracture responses between the MHEh group compared with the MHN and control groups. "
general pathological conditions,Nocturnal faecal soiling and anal masturbation. Two cases of late onset faecal soiling as a result of anal masturbation in children who were neither mentally handicapped nor psychotic were studied. The role of soiling in aiding the young person and his family to avoid separating and maturing is highlighted. We suggest that the association of anal masturbation and resistant nocturnal soiling may be unrecognised. 
general pathological conditions,"Peritoneal closure or non-closure at cesarean. The value of peritoneal closure at the time of cesarean birth was evaluated prospectively. Two hundred forty-eight women undergoing low transverse cesarean through a Pfannenstiel skin incision were assigned to one of two groups: peritoneum open (N = 127) or peritoneum closed (N = 121). The mean (+/- SEM) surgical time in the open group (48.1 +/- 1.2 minutes) was significantly less than for the closed group (53.2 +/- 1.4 minutes) (P less than .005). There were no postoperative differences between the groups in the incidence of wound infection, dehiscence, endometritis, ileus, and length of hospital stay. Our study suggests that leaving the parietal peritoneum unsutured is an acceptable way to manage patients at cesarean delivery. "
general pathological conditions,Pontine supranuclear facial palsy. Two patients presented with a unilateral supranuclear facial palsy. Additional dysarthria was attributed to the pontine origin documented by magnetic resonance imaging on the contralateral side. The pontine disorder also was indicated by an isolated delay of the blink reflex R1 component or of the masseter reflex. We attribute the facial palsy to a lesion of a supranuclear fiber bundle supplying the facial nucleus. The location of the lesions favors these fibers taking a separate course from the main pyramidal tract at the mid- to upper pontine level. 
general pathological conditions,"Susceptibility to invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b disease and the immunoglobulin G2m(n) allotype. There has been considerable controversy about the role of the immunoglobulin G2m(n) allotype and risk of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease. This allotype was studied in a large cohort of Finnish children (178) with invasive Hib disease. The G2m(n) allotype distribution was similar to that in the normal white Finnish population. No increased risk of Hib disease could be associated with the n-/n- genotype [i.e., lack of G2m(n) allotype]. Thus, the G2m(n) allotype does not seem to be a major determinant of susceptibility to Hib infection among white populations in industrialized countries. "
general pathological conditions,"Detrusor hyper-reflexia as a factor in spontaneous perforation of augmentation cystoplasty for neuropathic bladder. In a series of 30 children undergoing cystoplasty for neuropathic bladder, 14 had a combination of a competent sphincteric mechanism and detrusor hyper-reflexia. All 3 cases of spontaneous perforation of the augmentation occurred within this latter group and it is postulated that excessive intravesical pressure due to high pressure hyper-reflexia was the causal factor. Strategies to reduce the risk of perforation are discussed. "
general pathological conditions,"Incidental demonstration of pericardial fistula during hepatobiliary scintigraphy. Biliary vomiting developed 16 mo after resection of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus in a patient with a complex postoperative course. A biliary scan revealed an outline of the pericardium, suggesting a fistula. The potential role of radionuclide imaging in this rare and potentially fatal complication is discussed. "
general pathological conditions,"Respiratory epithelium in a cystic choristoma of the limbus. A female newborn had a cystic, whitish gray mass at the inferotemporal limbus of the left eye. At age 3 weeks, the newborn underwent excision of the tumor, corneal patch grafting, and superior sector optical iridectomy. Histopathologic and electron microscopic examination of the excised tissue revealed a choristoma consisting of cysts lined with respiratory epithelium. To our knowledge, respiratory epithelium in a limbal choristoma has not been previously reported. "
general pathological conditions,"Traumatic aneurysm of the superior cerebellar artery: case report and review of the literature. Less than 10% of the 250 reported cases of traumatic intracranial aneurysms have involved the posterior circulation. Traumatic aneurysms of the superior cerebellar artery are extremely rare, with only three cases previously reported. This is the first report of a traumatic superior cerebellar artery aneurysm in which the diagnosis was suggested by computed tomographic scan. The potential for a good outcome suggests the value of early angiography when the history and diagnostic imaging studies suggest the possibility of a traumatic aneurysm. "
general pathological conditions,Mistaken diagnoses in continuous muscle fiber activity of peripheral nerve origin. The syndrome of continuous muscle fiber activity of peripheral nerve origin has manifestations that resemble those of many other more common neurologic disorders during childhood and infancy. This similarity often leads to misdiagnosis when an adequate index of suspicion is not entertained and a comprehensive electromyographic examination is not performed. Two affected patients from 1 family are reported to illustrate the type of diagnostic errors that were made before the establishment of the correct diagnosis. 
general pathological conditions,"Saltpeter ingestion. A 37-year-old man presented to the emergency department after an attempt to self-treat his priapism with saltpeter (K+NO3). Initially he had a potassium of 7.6 with electrocardiographic changes and a markedly elevated CO2. The potassium and carbon dioxide normalized in less than 24 hours with standard treatment for hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia is expected with large oral potassium ingestion; and the elevated CO2 was spurious, caused by the misreading of serum nitrates by the Ektachrom 700 system. Ingestion of K+NO3 should be added to the differential of hyperkalemia with a markedly elevated CO2. "
general pathological conditions,"Salvage from cardiogenic shock by atherectomy after failed emergency coronary artery angioplasty. In this case report of a patient undergoing angioplasty for cardiogenic shock during acute myocardial infarction, recurrent occlusion resulted in recurrence of shock. Atherectomy reestablished lasting patency and reversed the patient's hemodynamic collapse. Atherectomy deserves further investigation as a means to salvage vessel patency during unsuccessful coronary angioplasty. "
general pathological conditions,"Insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia: role in hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary heart disease. Resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and hyperinsulinemia may play a central role in the cause and clinical course of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism, and coronary heart disease. This article summarizes the evidence in support of this general hypothesis. "
general pathological conditions,"Combined computed tomography and dacryocystography for complex lacrimal problems. Two imaging modalities, computed tomography (CT) and dacryocystography (DCG), were combined to demonstrate the relationships between the lacrimal system and the surrounding soft-tissue structures. In selected cases, such as those involving severe facial trauma, midfacial tumours, significant sinus disease, or previous lacrimal, nasal or sinus surgery, this imaging technique may be useful in better evaluating the anatomy of the lacrimal system and planning a surgical approach. "
general pathological conditions,"Continuous epidural hydromorphone for postthoracotomy pain relief Forty-four patients were treated with a continuous infusion of lumbar epidural hydromorphone (0.05%) after thoracic operations. Postoperatively, visual analog pain scores were obtained. On postoperative day 1 and 2, more than 90% of the patients experienced either no pain (visual analog pain scale = 0) or mild pain (visual analog pain score = 1 to 3) at rest. The incidence of side effects (hypoventilation, pruritis, and nausea) was less than reported with other epidurally administered opioids. Continuous infusion of lumbar epidural hydromorphone produced safe, predictable analgesia after thoracotomy. "
general pathological conditions,The Indian experience with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. A study of 58 consecutive Indian infants operated for congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis revealed an accentuated male predominance in the incidence of the disease and far less preoperative hemetemesis as compared to that in their Western counterparts. 'Pyloric tumor' was palpable in 89% of cases. Only 34.5% of these infants were first born. Postoperative vomiting occurred in 13.8% of patients and wound sepsis was not encountered. Air contrast radiography confirmed the diagnosis in clinically doubtful cases. 
general pathological conditions,Cortical blindness after coronary angiography: a rare but reversible complication. Transient cortical blindness is a recognized complication after vertebral and cerebral angiography but is a rare event after cardiac angiography. The development of cortical blindness appears to be an adverse reaction to the contrast agent which results in an osmotic disruption of the blood-brain barrier which appears to be selective for the occipital cortex. Patient outcome appears to be generally favorable with return of vision within 24-48 hr. This study describes three patients who had transient cortical blindness after cardiac catheterization and reviews what is known about this unusual problem. 
general pathological conditions,The appearance of the piriformis muscle syndrome in computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. A case report and review of the literature. The piriformis syndrome (PS) is a controversial cause of hip pain because of the lack of objective findings to support the diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed PS in a 27-year-old woman. This case may be one of the first reports in the literature on a piriformis muscle enlargement documented by CT and MR imaging. 
general pathological conditions,"Reversible myopathy due to labetalol. A severe, generalized myopathy developed in 2 children treated with labetalol. An 11-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy demonstrated proximal weakness and markedly elevated creatine kinase levels during labetalol therapy. Clinical improvement began immediately when labetalol administration was halted; muscle strength was normal within 2 months. Muscle biopsies were consistent with rhabdomyolysis. "
general pathological conditions,"A huge intracranial xanthogranuloma in the middle cranial fossa: case report. Xanthogranulomas of the dura presenting with clinical symptoms are rare. We report here a case of a huge dural xanthogranuloma in the middle cranial fossa, which caused hemiparesis through marked displacement and stenosis of the middle cerebral artery. Although such tumors usually arise in association with histiocytosis X or familial hyperlipoproteinemia, the present case was not associated with these diseases. "
general pathological conditions,"Retinal sensitivity in acute hypoglycemia. We measured retinal threshold sensitivity via automated computerized static perimetry in predetermined meridians in euglycemic diabetic subjects and in the same subjects during insulin-induced hypoglycemia. During periods of reduced blood glucose levels, decreased retinal sensitivity, most marked in temporal meridians, was observed. "
general pathological conditions,"Massive histamine release in a patient with systemic mastocytosis. We have measured plasma histamine concentrations, systemic vascular resistance, cardiac output and arterial pressure during laparotomy in a patient with systemic mastocytosis. The patient developed vasodilation and hypotension during surgery, associated with a massive increase in plasma histamine concentration. "
general pathological conditions,"An evaluation of the Level 1 blood warmer series The Level 1 blood warmer series comprises three infusion sets and two blood warmers of different power outputs. All systems were found to be extremely efficient, with the larger 500 series capable of warming the equivalent of 80 units of blood an hour almost to body temperature. "
general pathological conditions,"Acute upper airway obstruction following Teflon injection of a vocal cord; the value of nebulized adrenaline and a helium/oxygen mixture in its management A 67-year-old man presented with a 45-year history of a week voice. This was result of polio which had left him with a right vocal cord palsy. The patient underwent a Teflon injection of the right vocal cord under general anaesthesia to improve the quality of his voice. In the immediate post-operative period, he suffered acute upper airway obstruction. The problem of acute upper airway obstruction following Teflon injection is considered and its management with nebulized adrenaline and a helium/oxygen mixture is discussed. "
general pathological conditions,Pyoderma gangrenosum complicating Felty's syndrome. The case of a 54-year-old woman with Felty's syndrome whose course was complicated by mucocutaneous lesions clinically typical of pyoderma gangrenosum is described. Necrotizing sinusitis and saddle nose deformity were distinctive clinical features. Lymphocytic vasculitis and rheumatoid nodule formation observed within panniculus at the base of a cutaneous lesion and in a nasal mucosal lesion were unexpected histopathologic findings. 
general pathological conditions,"Patients' observations of bioprosthetic valve failure: ""my heart is honking, doctor"". Audible cardiac murmurs are uncommon and may indicate severe native valve dysfunction. In six patients with bioprosthetic mitral valves audible honking systolic murmurs suddenly developed. Doppler echocardiography showed characteristic striated regurgitant signals. At operation each prosthesis had torn cusps. New audible murmurs and striated Doppler signals originating from mitral bioprosthetic valves are indicators of cusp tears. Recognition of this is important because early detection of prosthetic valve dysfunction may improve subsequent surgical outcome. "
general pathological conditions,"Brain and spinal cord hemorrhage in long-term survivors of malignant pediatric brain tumors: a possible late effect of therapy. Three children with malignant primary CNS tumors treated with craniospinal radiotherapy developed intraparenchymal hemorrhages a median of 5 years following therapy in sites distant from the primary tumor. Radical surgical procedures disclosed fresh and old hematoma, gliosis, and necrosis in all 3 patients and an aggregation of abnormal microscopic blood vessels in two. No tumor was found. All 3 patients remain in long-term (greater than 10 years) continuous remission. "
general pathological conditions,"Does ethamsylate reduce haemorrhage in transurethral prostatectomy? A double-blind, randomised trial of 44 consecutive patients undergoing transurethral prostatectomy demonstrated that ethamsylate (Dicynene) did not reduce blood loss during either the operative or the post- operative periods. "
general pathological conditions,"Obstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous return. Toward neutralization of a major risk factor. Among 57 neonates undergoing repair of total anomalous pulmonary venous return with severe pulmonary venous obstruction from 1980 through 1989, date of operation (1980 to 1984), preoperative hemodynamic instability, and failure to monitor pulmonary artery pressure postoperatively were risk factors for death. Thus, among the 30 patients having repair between 1985 and 1989, the 55-month survival rate including hospital deaths was 83%. "
general pathological conditions,"Eosinophilic ascites due to hyperinfection with Strongyloides stercoralis. We report the case of a patient with cryptogenic cirrhosis, new onset ascites, and hyperinfection with Strongyloides stercoralis who had significant eosinophilia of the peritoneal fluid. The eosinophilia resolved with treatment of the S. stercoralis infection, and did not recur during two subsequent episodes of ascites and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Eosinophilic ascites is rare in parasitic infection, but it has been described in a variety of disorders which are discussed. "
general pathological conditions,"Recurrent urethral stricture disease managed by clean intermittent self-catheterization. We studied 41 patients with urethral stricture who had failed at least 1 operation, and were being maintained with filiform and follower dilation every 6 to 12 weeks. The patients were instructed in clean intermittent self-catheterization with a 16F red rubber catheter, which was performed every 1 to 30 days. Followup from 9 to 36 months revealed excellent compliance and average peak uroflow rates increased from 5.5 cc per second before dilation to 17.1 cc per second at the last followup visit. Clean intermittent self-catheterization is a simple method to maintain a patent urethra and obviates the need for further operations or painful dilations. "
general pathological conditions,"Spontaneous rupture of the spleen in initial presentation of Hodgkin's disease. A 46-year-old man presented with a four-week history of fevers, occasional chills, and a two-week history of sweats and poor appetite. He also complained of progressive weakness and lethargy. After initial evaluation, while awaiting further consultation, the patient developed rapidly progressing abdominal pain and light-headedness. He was moved immediately into the emergency treatment area. He was noted to have an acute abdomen and was taken to surgery. An enlarged Hodgkin's-infiltrated spleen with an actively bleeding hematoma was removed. The patient denied any history of trauma. "
general pathological conditions,Heterotopic supradiaphragmatic liver formation in association with congenital cardiac anomalies. Heterotopic supradiaphragmatic liver formation is extremely rare. We studied a case of heterotopic liver in a 26-week fetus with severe cardiac and conotruncal anomalies. The cardiac anomalies are strikingly similar to those of a previously described patient with heterotopic supradiaphragmatic liver. The cardiac anomalies and heterotopic supradiaphragmatic liver formation may be mechanistically related. 
general pathological conditions,"Preoperative radiotherapy in operable rectal cancer. The effect of preoperative radiotherapy (31.5 Gy in 3.5 weeks) in operable rectal cancer was examined with respect to resectability and prognosis after two surgical procedures, abdominoperineal resection, or low anterior resection. Preoperative radiation did not influence the surgeon's selection of low anterior resection, which was similar (40 percent) in each group. Radiation improved five-year survival probability and decreased the incidence of local recurrence significantly after low anterior resection. In contrast, no improvement of treatment results was found in patients treated by abdominoperineal resection after radiotherapy. "
general pathological conditions,Adult respiratory distress syndrome after limited resection of adenocarcinoma of the lung. Two cases of the adult respiratory distress syndrome developed after limited resection for lung carcinoma. No other known precipitants were evident. The adult respiratory distress syndrome is a clinical expression of acute lung injury that may arise from various insults and include air and blood borne factors. Tumour related blood borne factors may have contributed to lung injury in these cases. 
general pathological conditions,"Multifocal gastric carcinoma arising from hyperplastic and adenomatous polyps. This paper is a presentation of the unusual case of a 61-yr-old woman operated on for multiple gastric cancers. Two of the cancers were found in the hyperplastic polyps and one in the adenoma. Apart from cancers that arose from these polyps, there were four separate polypoid or flat gastric carcinomas and three other hyperplastic polyps with no signs of malignancy, in this case. The presentation is followed by a detailed discussion focusing on the possible development of carcinoma in gastric hyperplastic polyps in view of the data from the literature. "
general pathological conditions,"Blood loss reduced during hip arthroplasty by lumbar plexus block. We measured the blood loss during and after hip replacement in two groups of women, each consisting of 10 patients. In one group the lumbar plexus was infiltrated with bupivacaine, in the other it was not. The group in whom the plexus was blocked had significantly less blood loss. "
general pathological conditions,"Cartilaginous metaplasia of the epiglottis. Metaplastic elastic cartilaginous tissue has been described in the vocal cord, vestibular fold and ventricle of the larynx. This report documents a case in which cartilaginous metaplasia developed in the soft tissue of the epiglottis following an episode of epiglottitis. "
general pathological conditions,"Dynamic analysis of the Harrington system using a spinal simulator. The authors constructed a spinal simulator for the thoracolumbar spine with mechanical properties similar to those of cadaver specimens, and studied the effectiveness of the Harrington system in unstable fractures of the thoracolumbar spine. Distraction and compression rods were applied under various conditions. External bending moment was applied to the model to measure the internal bending moment on the vertebral body and ligaments. Optimal spinal stability was obtained when the distraction system was combined with the compression system with hooks at laminas three levels above and below the fracture. "
general pathological conditions,"Aortobronchial fistula after an aortic operation. A 71-year-old man with a postoperative aortobronchial fistula was successfully treated. The fistula occurred between the left lower lobe and the descending thoracic aorta, to which a distal anastomosis of a temporary bypass graft had been placed during thoracic aortic aneurysmectomy 3 years before. For saving patients with this complication, early surgical treatment during episodes of intermittent hemoptysis is important. The use of an omentum pedicle flap for the isolation of the suture line is a important adjunct. "
general pathological conditions,"Recurrent herpes gestationis with postpartum flare: a case report. A case of herpes gestationis recurring in each pregnancy, with a postpartum flare-up in the last pregnancy, is described. The diagnosis was confirmed by skin biopsy. The first pregnancy ended in a term stillbirth, but there were favorable outcomes in four subsequent pregnancies. Histopathologic examination of the placentas of the last three pregnancies revealed varying grades of villositis. Symptoms improved with oral corticosteroids. "
general pathological conditions,"Intravenous fluid load and recovery. A double-blind comparison in gynaecological patients who had day-case laparoscopy. The effect of intra-operative fluid and dextrose administration upon recovery was tested in a randomised, double-blind trial. Three groups of 25 patients, each undergoing laparoscopic examination as day cases, were studied. The two groups who received fluid (20 ml/kg compound sodium lactate solution) showed significant improvement (p less than 0.05) in the variables that reflected hydration. The fluid group who also received dextrose (1 g/kg) exhibited further significant improvement. Intra-operative fluid and dextrose administration appears to confer some benefit upon recovery in patients who have minor surgery. "
general pathological conditions,A case of amnesia after excision of the septum pellucidum. Tumours of the septum pellucidum (SP) are rare and seldom associated with memory impairment either before or after operation. A patient is described who developed amnesia after transcallosal excision of a tumour of the SP. Radiology did not show any major lesion of the brain areas traditionally associated with amnesia. Because septal nuclei could have been damaged during surgery their possible role in memory functions is discussed. 
general pathological conditions,Circumflex artery ventricular fistula and pseudoaneurysm after mitral reoperation. Prosthetic mitral valve reoperation complicated by atrioventricular groove pseudoaneurysm and circumflex ventricular fistula is presented. Ligation of the circumflex artery during mitral valve replacement is implicated after review of a previous cardiac angiogram. 
general pathological conditions,"Entrapment of a folded-over introducer sheath in the iliofemoral artery: an unusual complication of PTCA guiding catheter exchange An arterial introducer sheath became folded over in the iliac artery during PTCA. This probably resulted from withdrawal of a doubled over Judkins left coronary guiding catheter through the introducer sheath. Nonsurgical, atraumatic removal was accomplished after the acute bend of the introducer sheath had been withdrawn to the site of arterial entrance. "
general pathological conditions,"Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis in childhood (Sweet's syndrome). We report a case of Sweet's syndrome in childhood. Our patients suffered from repeated fevers, chest infections and had characteristic erythematous plaques. The severity of his illness increased with age and warranted oral steroid treatment. We review 16 cases reported to date in the literature and comment on the management and prognosis of the disease in childhood. "
general pathological conditions,"Isometric features of orthostatic tremor: an electromyographic analysis. A patient is described with ""orthostatic"" tremor. Electromyography revealed tremor bursts of 15 Hz in the lower extremities while standing and with isometric activation of the muscles, but the bursts disappeared with isotonic activation of muscles. Similar tremor was recorded in the arms with isometric, but not isotonic activation. Review of previously reported cases confirms these findings. The clinical and electrophysiologic features of this tremor distinguish it from other recognized forms of tremor. "
general pathological conditions,"Surgical treatment for severe slipping of the upper femoral epiphysis. We have used a modified technique of cervical osteotomy to treat a consecutive series of 23 patients with chronic slip of the upper femoral epiphysis. It has been successful in correcting both moderate and severe deformities with a low incidence of avascular necrosis, comparable to that seen after subtrochanteric osteotomies. We describe the operative details and discuss the features which make cervical osteotomy technically superior to intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric procedures. "
general pathological conditions,"Total unilateral lung gangrene in Hodgkin's disease: treatment by thoracostomy. Total gangrene of the left lung developed in a 30-year-old male patient with a pulmonary recurrence of Hodgkin's disease after mediastinal irradiation and chemotherapy. Clinically, tension pyopneumothorax and severe septic shock were present. Surgical repair was done by thoracostomy, resecting three ribs. A 2 x 0.5-cm hole in the necrotic wall of the left main bronchus was covered with an intercostal muscle bundle. The necrotic pleural surfaces were treated openly by daily change of dressings. The patient recovered satisfactorily and underwent four further courses of chemotherapy without any complications. "
general pathological conditions,Arteriovenous fistula as a complication of temporary pacemaker insertion: treatment with percutaneous embolization. Arteriovenous fistula is a rare complication of central venous catheterization. We present a case of right internal mammary artery-to-right innominate vein fistula resulting from emergent insertion of a temporary pacemaker. Percutaneous management is discussed and the literature is reviewed. 
general pathological conditions,Syringomyelia as a postoperative sequela of the resection of a chordoma of the clivus: case report. Syringomyelia has been described frequently in association with various abnormalities of the skull base but rarely with tumors of the skull base. Syringomyelia as a postoperative sequela of surgery of the skull base has not been reported. The authors describe a case of cervical syringomyelia developing after the partial resection of a chordoma and combined conventional and proton beam irradiation. The possible mechanisms causing this abnormality are discussed. 
general pathological conditions,"Botulinum A toxin for the treatment of adult-onset spasmodic torticollis. Thirty-five patients with adult-onset idiopathic torticollis were treated by local injections of botulinum A toxin into dystonic cervical muscles. Substantial improvement with respect to reduction and elimination of pain was found in 81 percent, improvement in posture deformity and involuntary spasms in 70 percent, increased range of motion of the neck in 78 percent, reduction in visible sternocleidomastoid hypertrophy in 86 percent, and improvement in tremor in 65 percent. The syndrome was divided into four subtypes based on pattern of dystonic muscle groups involved in the dystonia, head and shoulder posture, and sternocleidomastoid muscle hypertrophy. Injection strategy based on this subdivision is described. "
general pathological conditions,"Musculoskeletal abnormalities in a patient with juvenile hypothyroidism. Abnormalities in growth and development are the most striking clinical features of juvenile acquired hypothyroidism. Therefore, physicians should consider the diagnosis of hypothyroidism in any child with musculoskeletal growth dysfunction. Drs Kilpatrick and Fincher describe a case demonstrating the severe and potentially irreversible effects of prolonged, untreated hypothyroidism. "
general pathological conditions,"An evaluation of a 30-gauge needle for spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section. A 30-gauge spinal needle was evaluated for Caesarean section, using a combined epidural/spinal technique, in 50 mothers. Spinal anaesthesia failed in six mothers and was inadequate in another six. General anaesthesia was required on one occasion. A 25% overall failure rate suggests that a 30-gauge needle is not a practical proposition for routine clinical practice. "
general pathological conditions,"Mycobacterium chelonei keratopathy with visual rehabilitation by a triple procedure. We report a chronic keratouveitis following an eye injury, the etiology of which remained obscure despite repeated corneal scrapings and cultures. Eventually, the diagnosis was established by culturing Mycobacterium chelonei from a corneal biopsy specimen. Topical amikacin resolved active inflammation, but dense corneal scarring and a cataract remained. Visual rehabilitation was achieved through a combined penetrating keratoplasty, extracapsular cataract extraction, and intraocular lens implantation. This case illustrates that there should be a high index of suspicion of atypical mycobacteria when faced with any unusual keratitis, particularly following penetrating injuries and corneal grafts. "
general pathological conditions,Gastric duplication cyst communicating with the pancreatic duct: a rare cause of recurrent abdominal pain. A 41-year-old woman with recurrent attacks of postprandial abdominal pain was found on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and subsequent computed tomographic scan to have an enteric duplication within the substance of the pancreas with communication to the pancreatic duct. Celiotomy demonstrated a noncontiguous gastric duplication cyst. Internal drainage was curative. 
general pathological conditions,"Determination of ventricular fluid outflow resistance in patients with ventriculomegaly. Resorption of the ventricular fluid was studied by measuring ventricular fluid outflow resistance during steady state 1.5 and 5.0 ml/min infusions in 26 patients with substantial enlargement of the supratentorial ventricular system. This test may avoid unnecessary use of shunts, but a shunt could be introduced during the same procedure. "
general pathological conditions,"Chilaiditi's syndrome. A diagnostic challenge. Chilaiditi's syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal and chest pain. Although interposition of the right colon is a relatively common radiologic finding, there is a distinct paucity of information in the medical literature. Chilaiditi's syndrome is usually asymptomatic, but when symptoms occur, conservative treatment is usually effective. Recognition is important because this syndrome can be mistaken for more serious abnormalities, which may lead to unnecessary surgical intervention. "
general pathological conditions,"A study of the comparative efficacy of four common analgesics in the control of postsurgical dental pain. Four common oral analgesics were tested in a single-blind trial to determine their relative efficacy in the management of postsurgical pain in 103 patients who had their impacted third molars surgically removed under general anesthesia. The analgesics tested were acetylsalicylic acid (26 patients), ibuprofen (26 patients), a paracetamol/codeine/caffeine combination (Solpadeine) (25 patients), and dihydrocodeine (26 patients). The paracetamol/codeine/caffeine combination, ibuprofen, and acetylsalicylic acid preparations produced equally effective analgesia. Dihydrocodeine was found to be a poor analgesic in this pain model. There were no adverse reactions to any of the preparations. "
general pathological conditions,Use of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) in a Jehovah's Witness refusing transfusion of blood products: case report. Recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) administration to a Jehovah's witness refusing blood transfusions increased her nadir packed cell volume from 13% to 37% and reticulocyte count from 2% to 17.7%. R-HuEPO may provide an alternative safe and effective therapy in life-threatening anemia when blood transfusions are unacceptable to the patient. 
general pathological conditions,Pivotal role of early and sustained infarct vessel patency in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction unequivocally has improved short- and long-term mortality. The fundamental goal of therapy for evolving myocardial infarction is early and sustained infarct vessel recanalization. The mechanisms linking an open artery with improved long-term survival and other clinical outcomes are presented with use of data from extensive clinical trials. 
general pathological conditions,Simplified technique for isolating vascularized rib periosteal grafts. A modified technique for obtaining a vascularized rib periosteal segment utilizing the posterolateral approach is presented. The technique avoids the inclusion of a large muscle cuff or the pleura around the isolated rib segment and therefore minimizes donor-site morbidity and chest complications previously associated with this approach. 
general pathological conditions,The treatment of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome by limbic leucotomy. A patient with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome and severe self-injurious compulsions who had failed to respond to drug treatment and behavioural therapy obtained a complete and sustained resolution of his destructive behaviour and improvement in his tics following bilateral limbic leucotomy. 
general pathological conditions,"Paraneoplastic brachial plexopathy in a patient with Hodgkin's disease. We describe a case of inflammatory brachial plexopathy that occurred in the context of a mild, diffuse sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy associated with Hodgkin's disease. Clinical, electrophysiologic, and pathologic studies helped distinguish this disorder from other causes of brachial plexopathy in patients with cancer. Treatment with corticosteroids seemed beneficial in this patient. We suggest that this may be another type of paraneoplastic condition associated with Hodgkin's disease. "
general pathological conditions,"Reduced psychological morbidity after breast conservation. Psychological morbidity was compared in 52 patients treated by mastectomy and 67 patients treated by lumpectomy for early breast cancer. An informal counselling service was provided for all patients. Morbidity was measured at 6, 9 and 12 months after surgery with two self-rating scales: the general health questionnaire and the Leeds depression and anxiety scales. There was a significant excess of severe depression in the mastectomy group. In contrast to the findings of previous research, this result suggests that breast conservation reduces psychological morbidity. "
general pathological conditions,Clonal deletion of V beta 14-bearing T cells in mice transgenic for mammary tumour virus. Autoreactive T lymphocytes are clonally deleted during maturation in the thymus. Deletion of T cells expressing particular receptor V beta elements is controlled by poorly defined autosomal dominant genes. A gene has now been identified by expression of transgenes in mice which causes deletion of V beta 14+ T cells. The gene lies in the open reading frame of the long terminal repeat of the mouse mammary tumour virus. 
general pathological conditions,"Use of H2-receptor antagonists in children. H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) have evolved into the mainstay of anti-acid therapy for pediatric patients, replacing antacids and other modes of therapy. Much of the experience and data used for therapeutic decisions in children, however, have been extrapolated from adult studies. Ranitidine and cimetidine have been studied most extensively in the adult and pediatric populations. Both raise gastric pH and achieve other therapeutic endpoints; however, cimetidine appears to have a greater frequency of both adversed effects and drug interactions. H2RAs are the preferred agents for prevention of stress ulcers, ulcer disease, and reflux esophagitis in the pediatric population. "
general pathological conditions,"Experience with Duraphase penile prosthesis: its use as replacement device. The Duraphase Penile Prosthesis is a new, articulating type of semirigid prosthesis which appears to have several advantages over other semirigid penile prostheses. This series describes the experience with this prosthesis in 12 patients and highlights the experience in 4 patients who underwent removal of other types of prostheses due to mechanical or functional problems and replacement with the Duraphase prosthesis. The device has been mechanically reliable during short follow-up, and there has been excellent patient satisfaction. "
general pathological conditions,"Neurologic assessment. Neurologic nursing assessment requires the knowledge of anatomic and physiologic principles as well as the mastery of complex assessment skills. The nurse who is often the first and most consistent health team member interacting with clients may provide the key to the early recognition, prevention, and treatment of neurologic problems. The nurse, as the dynamic member of the health team, may then be the first line of defense in initiating cost-effective and perhaps life-saving measures in neurologically impaired clients. "
general pathological conditions,"Experimental oral foreign body reactions: vegetable materials. Foreign bodies and tissue reactions to foreign materials are commonly encountered in the oral cavity. Exogenous materials most commonly causing foreign body reactions are metallic in origin (usually amalgam). Of the nonmetallic materials seen during biopsies, suture materials and vegetable matter are most often observed. Since many foodstuff foreign materials are unidentifiable histologically, common vegetables were experimentally implanted subcutaneously in rats to assess local host responses and to characterize the nature of these materials microscopically. The histologic characteristics of these vegetable foreign body reactions are detailed herein. The implanted materials correspond to reactions seen in human subjects. "
general pathological conditions,"Obesity and vaginal hysterectomy. A retrospective study was done of 471 consecutive vaginal hysterectomies done in a three-year period. Three groups of patients--239 normal to 9% overweight, 132 10-24% overweight and 100 greater than or equal to 25% overweight--were compared. Surgical difficulties were similar in all three groups. The more obese patient had a slightly greater incidence of febrile morbidity, stayed one day longer in the hospital and had a minimally greater loss of hemoglobin 48 hours postoperatively. However, obesity per se caused few problems during and after vaginal hysterectomy. The vaginal approach is the procedure of choice for hysterectomy in obese women. "
general pathological conditions,Subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema associated with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. We report a rare case of a patient in whom severe subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema occurred in association with summer-type hypersensitivity pneumonitis and in whom overdistention or disruption of alveoli with obliteration of the respiratory bronchioles was revealed on open lung biopsy. This case suggests that obstructive bronchiolitis with hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an etiologic factor of mediastinal emphysema. 
general pathological conditions,"Typhlitis due to Balantidium coli in captive lowland gorillas. Typhlitis caused by Balantidium coli and requiring surgical resection occurred in three captive lowland gorillas over a 30-month period. Not one of the other gorillas in the colony or their keepers was ill. B. coli is distributed widely geographically and widely among mammals. Asymptomatic commensalism predominates, but invasion of the colonic mucosa can produce diarrhea and dysentery and set the stage for local or systemic spread. "
general pathological conditions,"Techniques of adjustable suture strabismus surgery. Adjustable sutures allow eye muscle positions to be changed following strabismus surgery, when the patient is awake and able to cooperate in muscle balance testing. Bow-tie-knot and sliding-handle sutures can be adjusted within 24 hours after surgery. Scleral traction sutures, which can be used to fix the globe to periorbital tissues during postoperative healing, can be adjusted for up to 14 days after surgery. We describe these techniques as well as an adjustable loop suture for conjunctival closure. "
general pathological conditions,"Aggravation of human and experimental myasthenia gravis by contrast media. After observing a 72-year-old myasthenic patient develop an acute myasthenic exacerbation following the administration of routine diagnostic IV contrast material, an observation rarely described in the literature, we used the experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis model in rabbits injected with a contrast agent to simulate the situation. There was significant worsening of the decremental response to 3 Hz repetitive nerve stimulation from 40 +/- 29% to 55 +/- 27% following the IV administration of contrast agent at doses similar to those used in humans. IV calcium partially reversed this aggravation. Caution is merited when myasthenic patients are administered contrast media. "
general pathological conditions,"Lower respiratory tract infections. Although lower respiratory tract infections are frequently diagnosed in a primary care setting, they are still associated with a significant morbidity and mortality, which warrants a careful approach to treatment. Knowledge of the most common cause based on the age of the patient, location where the infection was acquired, and clinical presentation helps to direct empiric treatment. A few basic laboratory studies, especially a sputum Gram stain, can allow for more specific treatment. Identification of patients at increased risk for virulent organisms should make the primary care physician consider inpatient treatment along with an aggressive diagnostic workup and broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment. Prevention should always be considered. "
general pathological conditions,"The IVH complex of lesions: cerebrovascular injury in the preterm infant. The term intraventricular hemorrhage has become associated with a variety of cerebrovascular insults in preterm infants. Because of a shared pathophysiology and timing, these are the neurologic lesions to search for when evaluating sick preterm infants. This complex of lesions is common and, when parenchymal injury occurs, likely to result in neurologic sequelae. A review of the variety of injuries, their pathophysiology, their diagnosis by cranial ultrasonography, and their prognosis is offered. Emphasis is placed on the need for assessment over time when evaluating parenchymal lesions in preterm infants. "
general pathological conditions,"Abnormal differentiation of human papillomavirus-induced laryngeal papillomas. We studied the proliferation and differentiation of human laryngeal papillomas, which are benign tumors induced by human papillomaviruses. Immunofluorescent stains of tissues for a number of differentiation-specific proteins showed abnormal differentiation. Papilloma tissue fragments in vitro showed a slightly decreased fraction of proliferating cells that incorporated tritiated thymidine and a markedly reduced incorporation of tritiated uridine when compared with normal tissue. We propose that papillomavirus infection results in normal basal cell proliferation but abnormal terminal differentiation and that this abnormality significantly contributes to the hyperplasia of the papillomas. "
general pathological conditions,"Fourth branchial pouch anomaly. We present an extremely rare case of fourth branchial fistula in a 23-year-old male. The characteristic clinical feature was a recurrent left lower neck abscess which did not respond to appropriate medical and surgical therapy. Radiography and a computed tomographic scan with contrast material revealed a fistula running from the apex of the left pyriform sinus (internal opening) to the left lower neck abscess. The fistula tract was excised surgically. Histological examination of the excised fistula revealed a squamous epithelial lining and subepithelial lymphoid tissue. This pyriform sinus fistula is thought to be of fourth pharyngeal pouch origin, because of its surgical aspects and the histological findings of the excised fistula. "
general pathological conditions,"Topical treatment of necrotic foot ulcers in diabetic patients: a comparative trial of DuoDerm and MeZinc. An open randomized controlled study was carried out of 44 diabetic patients with necrotic foot ulcers treated with adhesive zinc oxide tape (MeZinc) or with an adhesive occlusive hydrocolloid dressing (DuoDerm). Fourteen of the 21 patients treated with MeZinc had their necrotic ulcers improved by at least 50% compared to six out of 21 with the hydrocolloid dressing (P less than 0.025). Fifteen patients showed an increase in the area of necrosis during the course of the 5-week study and of these, 10 had been treated with the hydrocolloid dressing. "
general pathological conditions,"Unilateral asterixis. We describe three patients with unilateral asterixis. One diabetic patient with a moderately-sized haematoma in the left putamen initially developed bilateral and symmetrical asterixis, which became confined to the right side as his diabetes mellitus was controlled. Two patients showed unilateral asterixis due to haematomas in the contralateral basal ganglia and thalamus, respectively. The present findings indicate that not only lesions of the thalamus but also those of the basal ganglia can cause unilateral asterixis, and bilateral and symmetrical asterixis does not necessarily exclude the presence of a focal mass lesion in the cerebrum. "
general pathological conditions,Ultrasound-guided aspiration for transient synovitis of the hip. We reviewed 15 children with transient synovitis of the hip who had aspiration of an effusion under local anaesthesia with ultrasound guidance. There were no significant complications; aspiration was useful for diagnosis and gave considerable symptomatic relief. We discuss the role of ultrasound in diagnosis and treatment. 
general pathological conditions,"Lobulated intradermal nevus. Report of three cases. We report the cases of three patients with lobulated intradermal nevi. Biopsy specimens showed similar findings, that is, fatty infiltration within nests of nevus cells, neuroid differentiation of nevus cells, and dermal fibrosis. Our cases probably represent an unusual form of regressing melanocytic nevus. "
general pathological conditions,"One-stage laryngotracheoplasty. This article documents the evolution of our approach to the repair of subglottic stenosis in infants. With increasing experience in the management of subglottic stenosis using the anterior cricoid split procedure, we extended our procedure to include older children. This then led to the use of the one-stage procedure for repair of severe and mature subglottic stenosis. We present the results of surgical repair in 13 patients. Extubation was accomplished in 12 of 13 patients using one-stage laryngotracheoplasty. "
general pathological conditions,"Myocarditis simulating acute transmural myocardial infarction. A patient with cardiogenic shock had typical electrocardiographic findings of acute anterior transmural myocardial infarction. Cardiac catheterization revealed normal coronary arteries and severe biventricular failure. Postmortem examination confirmed normal coronary arteries; acute myocarditis, but no evidence for infarction, was found. Electrocardiographic changes of myocarditis may be indistinguishable from acute transmural infarction. In suspected cases, cardiac catheterization should be considered prior to thrombolytic therapy. "
general pathological conditions,"Outpatient orthognathic surgery: criteria and a review of cases. Over a 9-year period, 87 orthognathic procedures were performed in an outpatient environment. Procedures performed included horizontal mandibular osteotomies, rapid palatal expansions, bilateral sagittal split osteotomies, posterior and anterior maxillary osteotomies, and Le Fort I osteotomies. Fourteen of these patients were subsequently admitted to a hospital for either observation or full inpatient care. The rates of admission varied for each of the procedures, with length of anesthesia statistically related to the frequency of admission. Patient selection criteria and facilities used are reviewed. "
general pathological conditions,"Stiffman syndrome: a rare paraneoplastic disorder? An unusual case of the stiffman syndrome, associated with an oat cell carcinoma of the bronchus, is reported. Pathological examination showed that it was due to an encephalomyelitis similar to that seen in paraneoplastic disorders. This suggests that atypical cases of the stiffman syndrome may occasionally be paraneoplastic. "
general pathological conditions,"Clinical and electrographic effects of acute anticonvulsant withdrawal in epileptic patients. We retrospectively investigated the effects of acute antiepileptic drug (AED) withdrawal on seizure symptomatology--including frequency, clinical features, and electrical onset--by studying 35 patients during evaluation for epilepsy surgery. The highest risk for both partial and secondary generalized seizures occurred during absent or subtherapeutic, and not during rapidly falling, AED levels. AED withdrawal had minimal effect on clinical symptomatology or electrographic onset. "
general pathological conditions,Urgent care center pediatric telephone advice. Pediatric telephone advice is sought frequently by members of the community. This study was undertaken to evaluate the quality and accuracy of pediatric telephone advice given by free-standing urgent care centers. One hundred such facilities were telephoned and advice was requested by a research assistant. A case was presented that could have represented a pediatric medical emergency. Overall only 17 centers gave adequate advice. The data suggest that under some circumstances free-standing urgent care center pediatric telephone advice may be inaccurate and inappropriate. Workable policies and protocols for pediatric telephone advice should be instituted by these facilities. 
general pathological conditions,"Ocular motor abnormalities from head trauma. Head injuries cause the hospitalization of 200-300 persons per 100,000 population per year. Ophthalmologists provide diagnostic and therapeutic care to those trauma victims with damage to the globe, optic nerve, orbit, and ocular motor system. Eye movements can be affected by damage at any level of the central nervous system or peripheral motor unit. Comprehensive ocular motor assessment of the trauma patient can substantially contribute to the understanding of the patient's injury, recovery, and rehabilitation. This review examines all aspects of head and face trauma that can lead to ocular motility disturbances. "
general pathological conditions,"Posttraumatic cortical blindness: are we missing the diagnosis in children? A potential etiology of anxiety and agitation in the posthead trauma patient is cortical blindness. Cortical blindness can be seen after both mild and severe head trauma. Early recognition and understanding of this syndrome can lead to a decreased anxiety level, not only for the patient, but for the parents as well. Two cases of posttraumatic cortical blindness are presented. The signs and symptoms of cortical blindness, its presentation, diagnosis, and outcome are discussed. The available literature is reviewed and discussed. "
general pathological conditions,"Neuropsychological assessment of cognitive functioning in children with epilepsy. The variety of cognitive dysfunctions related to learning disabilities in children with epilepsy have been studied by linking electroencephalogram (EEG) and computerized neuropsychological testing. This showed that ""subclinical"" discharges impaired performance in 61% of the patients on a simple and a choice reaction time test, although some discharges lasted 1 s only. Neuropsychological investigation of subclinical EEG discharges may help to determine their adverse effect on learning. "
general pathological conditions,"Otogenic Fusobacterium necrophorum meningitis. A case of meningitis secondary to acute suppurative otitis media in a previously healthy child is reported. The only organism isolated from blood after aerobic and prolonged anaerobic culture was identified as Fusobacterium necrophorum. Complete recovery followed treatment with surgery and prolonged antibiotic therapy. The role of anaerobes in the development of meningitis, the isolation and identification of Fusobacterium necrophorum, the clinical presentations of F. necrophorum infection and the choice of antibiotics in the treatment of these infections are discussed. "
general pathological conditions,"Psychological stress and the fibrositis/fibromyalgia syndrome. The relationship of stress and social support to the fibrositis/fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) was investigated by administration of 4 questionnaire instruments to 28 patients with FS, 20 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 28 pain-free normal controls. FS showed higher levels of stress as measured by daily ""hassles"" than did RA or controls. However, on a measure of major life stress, they reported lower levels. No differences were found between groups with regard to daily ""uplifts"" or social support. Correlations between those measures of stress and social support with their scores on the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale showed that the Hassles Scale was significantly related to the AIMS Psychological component. "
general pathological conditions,"A severe multisystem reaction to sulindac. We present a case of a severe reaction to sulindac. A 30-year-old woman with quiescent systemic lupus erythematosus received sulindac for nonspecific migrating chest pain. An initial course of therapy produced an unrecognized sensitization to the drug with a febrile illness and rash. Readministration of the drug caused an anaphylactoid reaction as well as evidence of cardiovascular, hepatic, pulmonary, and hematologic dysfunction. The patient's illness had evidence of types I, II, and III hypersensitivity reactions. "
general pathological conditions,"A prospective evaluation of the AO/ASIF universal femoral nail in the treatment of traumatic and reconstructive problems of the femur. Beginning in October 1986, we prospectively evaluated the AO/ASIF Universal Femoral Nail in the treatment of traumatic (89 nails) and reconstructive (11 nails) problems of the femur. For treatment of isolated femoral fractures, the mean time of patient positioning and nail insertion was 2.4 hours with a mean blood loss of 389 ml. Seventy-eight per cent of the patients were followed for a minimum of 12 months. There were no infections, one case of nail failure, two cases of screw fracture, and three nonunions. Sixteen nails have been uneventfully removed. The AO/ASIF femoral nail provides results comparable to other intramedullary interlocking devices. "
general pathological conditions,"Tongue ischemia from a soft-drink can: report of case. A young girl was brought to the emergency department because her tongue became entrapped while she was drinking from an aluminum soft-drink can. A dental drill was used to remove the can. The tongue was observed for 48 hours, during which an ischemic area recovered spontaneously. "
general pathological conditions,"The relapse of hairy cell leukemia after a 32-year remission. The optimum therapy for hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is controversial. Dramatic responses to interferon-alpha and 2'-deoxycoformycin overshadow the established role of splenectomy in HCL, and patients currently can avoid surgery altogether. A case is presented of clinical remission lasting 32 years after splenectomy--a prolonged normal life, without medication or medical intervention. When relapse occurred, the patient's response to interferon-alpha was prompt and predictable. Prognostic variables are an important consideration at the time of diagnosis in predicting the response to splenectomy. "
general pathological conditions,"Oxidative damage to lipids within the inflamed human joint provides evidence of radical-mediated hypoxic-reperfusion injury. Previous work has established the existence of a pathophysiological environment within the inflamed human joint, capable of sustaining a hypoxic-reperfusion event. Using four different assay systems (two standard and two novel) applied to synovial fluid for the assessment of lipid peroxidation, a series of studies demonstrate that exercise of the inflamed human knee promotes radical-mediated lipid peroxidation within the joint. The implication for novel antioxidant therapeutic approaches to inflammatory joint disease is discussed. "
general pathological conditions,"Passage of a colon 'cast' after anoabdominal rectal resection. Report of a case. The authors report a case of the passage of a total colonic J-pouch ""cast"" per anus after anoabdominal rectal resection and colonic J-pouch-anal anastomosis. This occurred without development of cuff abscess and was not due to occlusion of the inferior mesenteric artery. This was successfully treated, with preservation of anal function, with resection of the colonic J-pouch by transanal approach. "
general pathological conditions,"Fetal abdominal abnormalities associated with genetic syndromes. Sonographic technology has given the prenatal diagnostician the ability to accurately visualize fetal malformations. This article demonstrates the currently available capability of applying sonographically derived information concerning fetal dysmorphology to our knowledge of genetic disorders and syndromes. As a result, there can be a significant improvement in the management and counseling of these patients. After an initial discussion of normal embryology, principles of abdominal ultrasonography are discussed and applied to the following anomalies: omphalocele, gastroschisis, diaphragmatic hernia, duodenal atresia, other intestinal atresias and stenoses, renal anomalies, and obstructive uropathies. "
general pathological conditions,Traumatic subarachnoid-pleural fistula in a child. A case report. A seven-year-old girl sustained a gunshot wound to the chest and spine. Evaluation of a persistent pleural effusion demonstrated a subarachnoid-pleural fistula. Surgical closure of the dural defect resulted in resolution of the fistula. Traumatic subarachnoid-pleural fistulae are rare. The diagnosis is reached by an awareness of fistula formation from penetrating or blunt trauma to the chest. 
general pathological conditions,"Dosage of haloperidol for schizophrenia. Eighty-seven newly admitted inpatients with schizophrenia were randomized to receive 10, 30, or 80 mg/d of oral haloperidol. They were treated under double-blind conditions for 6 weeks, less if their acute symptoms remitted sooner. Survival analysis showed no differences among the three treatments. Side effects were minimal in all three treatment groups, and there were no differences in side effects among the groups. These results suggest that dosages higher than 10 mg/d of haloperidol for most patients have no additional beneficial effect in the treatment of acute or exacerbated schizophrenia. "
general pathological conditions,Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage associated with progressive systemic sclerosis. A 41 year old man with an eight year history of progressive systemic sclerosis developed severe diffuse alveolar haemorrhage and died. The importance of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage as a rare but potentially serious complication of connective tissue disease should not be overlooked. 
general pathological conditions,"Acute dissection of the internal mammary artery: a fatal complication of coronary artery bypass grafting. A case of acute traumatic dissection of the right internal mammary artery is presented in a patient who had both IMAs grafted for recurrent angina 10 years after initial vein coronary revascularisation. The event was mistaken for spasm, but because of severe circulatory collapse no time was available to treat the patient appropriately. The purpose of this report is to facilitate the early recognition and avoidance of this potentially fatal complication. "
general pathological conditions,"Spinal cord stimulation: a contemporary series Forty-three patients with chronic pain disorders of different causes were selected for spinal cord stimulation. All underwent implantation of a ribbon electrode through a small laminotomy, under general anesthesia. Thirteen patients (30%) failed to obtain significant pain relief during a period of trial stimulation, and their electrodes were removed. The remainder underwent a definitive implant and were followed for a mean of 13 months (range, 3-33 months). Nineteen of them (63%) continued to experience pain relief. A detailed analysis of this series, as well as a literature review, is presented. "
general pathological conditions,"Endosalpingosis as a cause of chronic pelvic pain. Endosalpingosis, a condition characterized by ectopic oviduct epithelium, is diagnosed histologically by the appearance of benign ciliated and nonciliated columnar cells in an abnormal location. Endosalpingosis is typically without symptoms. Our unusual case report shows symptomatic endosalpingosis first seen with chronic pelvic pain. Various aspects of this disease will also be discussed. "
general pathological conditions,Osler-Weber-Rendu disease and pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas. Deterioration and embolotherapy during pregnancy. Several reports have implicated pregnancy as a cause of deterioration in patients with pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas. We report a 27-year-old woman with multiple pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas who required coil spring embolotherapy in her 24th week of pregnancy due to a spontaneous hemothorax and hypoxemia. 
general pathological conditions,"Chronic pain. Understanding of the etiology of chronic pain is growing rapidly as researchers seek to integrate physiologic and psychosocial mechanisms. When nurses assess clients with chronic pain, they should make their assessments using both verbal and nonverbal methods and realize that no one instrument is comprehensive enough to be used alone. The key to successful treatment of these difficult clients lies in the use of a comprehensive approach that takes the client seriously and integrates both physiologic and psychosocial approaches. "
general pathological conditions,"Intracerebral hematoma complicating split calvarial bone-graft harvesting. A case is reported of an intracerebral hematoma following the harvest of split calvarial bone. Full recovery by the patient occurred. Complications following calvarial bone graft harvest are reviewed. Potential devastating complications warrant serious consideration of alternative sources of bone, especially in the purely elective surgical candidate. "
general pathological conditions,"Pediatric sinusitis. The role of endoscopic sinus surgery in cystic fibrosis and other forms of sinonasal disease. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery has altered the surgical treatment of sinus disease in adults. We report our experience with functional endoscopic sinus surgery in the pediatric population. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery was safe and effective and compared favorably with traditional surgery with regard to operative time, blood loss, and parental opinion. "
general pathological conditions,"Acute hypervolaemic haemodilution to avoid blood transfusion during major surgery 16 patients underwent acute hypervolaemic haemodilution with dextran 40 and Ringers lactate, to see whether this procedure could avoid preoperative blood transfusion. Packed cell volume (PCV) and oxygen extraction decreased, and cardiac index and pulmonary wedge pressure increased, although end-systolic area was unchanged. PCV was not significantly different between patients who lost less than or greater than 20% of their initial blood volume. This preoperative manoeuvre, which reduces loss of red blood cells, allowed major surgery to be completed safely without blood transfusion. "
general pathological conditions,"A histologic evaluation of the accuracy of TMJ diagnostic arthroscopy. Sixty-seven temporomandibular joints with internal derangement were examined with arthroscopy, and synovial biopsies were taken for histologic evaluation. Histologically, in 10 cases, the synovium appeared to be normal in appearance, 24 cases had moderate to severe synovitis, 11 cases showed hyperplastic synovitis, 13 cases showed synovial fibrosis, and foreign body granuloma was found in 9 cases. Correlation between arthroscopic observation and histologic findings disclosed an 89.1% specificity and 100% sensitivity. "
general pathological conditions,Laparoscopic repair of bladder injury. This case report describes laparoscopic suturing for bladder repair. This technique affords the laparoscopic surgeon another means of managing a surgical complication without resorting to laparotomy. 
general pathological conditions,Atlanto-axial subluxation in Down's syndrome. A case of atlanto-axial subluxation in a patient with Down's syndrome is described. The gradual deterioration in the patient's locomotor ability caused a delay in diagnosis. Patterns of presentation of this condition are discussed. 
general pathological conditions,Ototoxicity of cis-platinum and its relationship to eye colour. The following hypothesis is presented: that the susceptibility of an individual patient to hearing loss as a result of cis-platinum administration can be predicted on the basis of eye colour. The rationale is that the melanin content of the inner ears is related to that of the eyes; dark eyes contain more melanin than light-coloured eyes; and melanin causes the accumulation of the ototoxic drug within the inner ear. Hence those with dark eyes will suffer greater damage to the hearing than those with pale eyes. An investigation that confirmed this hypothesis is reported. In addition to cochlear damage there is a significant likelihood of damage to the auditory nerve as a result of the treatment. 
general pathological conditions,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura treated with high-dose intravenous gamma globulin. Plasma infusion and/or plasma exchange has become standard therapy in the treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The management of patients in whom such primary therapy fails is difficult and uncertain. We have described a patient who obtained a sustained remission with the use of high-dose IV gamma globulin after an initial response to aggressive plasma exchange was followed by prompt relapse. Our case and others suggest that high-dose IV IgG may induce remission in patients with TTP who do not respond to standard plasma infusion and/or exchange. 
general pathological conditions,"The efficacy of methylprednisolone in reducing flap edema. It has been suggested that systemic steroids reduce postoperative flap edema. This has been poorly documented by several reports based on subjective clinical observations. In an effort to provide quantitative data on methylprednisolone and edema, a flap edema model in the rat was developed based on the inferior epigastric vessels. Significant edema developed after 48 hours. Differing intraoperative doses of methylprednisolone were studied, producing a dose-response curve. A single low dose of intraoperative steroid is effective in reducing flap edema; previously recommended doses are probably excessive. "
general pathological conditions,"Epidermal dendritic S100 positive cells in necrobiosis lipoidica and granuloma annulare. Using an antibody to S100 protein, the number of dendritic cells above the basal layer in the epidermis was assessed in necrobiosis lipoidica and granuloma annulare. A statistically significantly higher number of these cells was found within the epidermis in necrobiosis lipoidica compared with granuloma annulare and normal skin. The numbers were similar to those seen in sarcoidosis and tuberculous reactions in the skin, which raises the possibility of an immune pathogenesis for necrobiosis lipoidica. "
general pathological conditions,"Dermatology and the human gene map. Chromosomal localization has been established for many genetic traits. Gene mapping may lead to the identification of disease genes, an understanding of pathogenesis, and the development of rational therapy, as well as facilitating antenatal diagnosis and genetic counselling. 'The new genetics' is therefore of great interest to the clinician. Unfortunately the complex technology and unfamiliar vocabulary of molecular biology often deter non-specialists from keeping abreast of these developments. This account explains the principles of gene mapping, discusses its relevance to dermatologists, and lists the established loci of dermatologically important genes. "
general pathological conditions,"Autoimmune chronic active hepatitis in a family. A positive family history of autoimmune disease is common among patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, but usually autoimmunity is directed at organs other than the liver. We document for the first time the multiple occurrence of autoimmune chronic active hepatitis in a family. Out of a sibship of seven, three sisters developed this, one sister developed coeliac and autoimmune thyroid disease, one sister showed serological signs of autoimmunity, while the two brothers were well with no signs of autoimmunity. HLA typing showed that in association with the female sex DR3 seems to be more important than B8 in conferring susceptibility to autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, at least in this family. "
general pathological conditions,"New horizons in management of hypothermia and frostbite injury. Diagnosing hypothermia requires a high index of suspicion. Restoring lost heat with careful attention to hemodynamics usually results in complete recovery. Frostbite is best treated by physicians who are cognizant of the pathophysiology of cold injury. Although alternative methods of intervention are being tested, rapid rewarming and anti-inflammatory agents are integral to treatment protocols. "
general pathological conditions,"Fetal imaging in the skeletal dysplasias. Second-trimester diagnosis of fetal skeletal dysplasia is becoming increasingly common. By careful examination of the fetus for skeletal mineralization, shape and size of long bones and cranium, and abnormalities of other organ systems, a definitive diagnosis can often be achieved by ultrasound. Fetal radiography is very helpful in giving more information about bone shape and mineralization as well as in confirming the diagnosis. Subsequent obstetric management should be dictated by the natural history of the disease, the parents' wishes, and the gestational age at diagnosis. Because many of these disorders have a high recurrence risk, genetic counseling and follow-up are an important part of the management of these patients. "
general pathological conditions,"Clinical results of axillobifemoral bypass using externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene Seventy-six axillobifemoral grafts with externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses were performed since 1983. The indications for operation were absolute (aortic sepsis) in 20 (26%) patients and relative (excessive operative risk or technical difficulty) in 56 (74%) patients. The life-table primary patency for these operations at 4 years follow-up (mean follow-up, 2 years, 4 months) was 85%. We conclude that the patency results achieved in this patient series are sufficiently satisfactory to warrant use of axillobifemoral grafts in an expanded number of patients with high operative risk and need for bypass of aortoiliac occlusive disease. "
general pathological conditions,"Unusual cerebral manifestations in hereditary fructose intolerance. Five children with hereditary fructose intolerance developed symptoms of neurological impairment. In three of them, neurological involvement was related to the acute hepatic toxicity of fructose (hypoglycemia, abnormal coagulation, cardiovascular collapse); in the other two, such a relationship could not be demonstrated. Neurological impairment is not classic in hereditary fructose intolerance, but its occurrence in the acute phase of the disease is possible and does not constitute an argument against the diagnosis. "
general pathological conditions,Emergency resuscitation in children. The role of intraosseous infusion. Intraosseous infusion is a temporary procedure for use in pediatric emergencies when intravenous access is difficult. Multiple drugs and fluids can be safely administered through the intraosseous route. Dosage and rate of infusion are essentially the same as with intravenous infusion. 
general pathological conditions,"Diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis of the mandible: a new concept of its etiology. Diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis of the mandible is a disease of unknown etiology. The clinical and radiographic findings suggest an infectious origin, but bacteriologic and histologic findings do not support this concept. Analysis of clinical symptoms, localization of the condition, and posttreatment findings in a group of 27 patients suggest a chronic tendoperiostitis due to muscular overuse as an etiologic factor in diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis of the mandible. This hypothesis was supported by the initial results of muscle relaxation treatment in 13 of these patients. "
general pathological conditions,Reoperation for intra-abdominal abscess. Reoperative procedures for patients with abscess and other septic complications remain among the most difficult management problems in general surgery. The diagnosis of intra-abdominal septic complications has been greatly enhanced within the last 10 years but remains imperfect and requires clinical judgment that transcends objective methods. Surgical drainage remains the mainstay of care for patients with postoperative intraabdominal abscess. 
general pathological conditions,"Application of microwave tissue coagulation in partial nephrectomy. Microwave tissue coagulation was used during partial nephrectomy in 10 mongrel dogs, without clamping the renal artery. There were no major complications, such as retroperitoneal hematoma, abscess formation, or macroscopic infarction of the kidney tissue related to this new procedure. The advantages of microwave coagulation are reduced blood loss, shorter operative time, and minimal risk of vascular injury. "
general pathological conditions,"Cochlear implants as a contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging poses little risk to the majority of patients undergoing scanning. However, cochlear implantation should pose a contraindication to this imaging process. This conclusion is based on several findings of in vitro testing of three cochlear implants: the 3M/House and 3M/Vienna designs and the Nucleus device. Specifically, tremendous torques are generated by each of these devices when they are introduced into the coil of a magnetic resonance imager; in addition, the 3M products not only were noted to induce an electrical current, but also were significantly magnetized and rendered afunctional. The clinical implications are discussed. "
general pathological conditions,"Outcome in Mania. A 4-year prospective follow-up of 75 patients utilizing survival analysis. A 4-year follow-up of 75 patients was conducted to investigate outcome after recovery from an episode of mania. Predictors of an unfavorable outcome included poor occupational status prior to index episode, history of previous episodes, history of alcoholism, psychotic features and symptoms of depression during the index manic episode, male gender, and interepisode affective symptoms at 6 months' follow-up. The mortality risk during the follow-up period was 4%. The identification of specific risk factors depended on the definition of outcome and the length of follow-up. "
general pathological conditions,"Urinary tract infection: economic considerations. Urinary tract infection results in significant morbidity and mortality while consuming large amounts of national resources. The prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infection produce both costs and benefits, and economic analysis provides a rational framework for looking at these effects. The goals and methods of economic analysis in medicine are summarized, and strategies to address uncomplicated cystitis, nosocomial urinary tract infection, and pyelonephritis are reviewed, with an emphasis on the economic trade-offs faced by decision makers. "
general pathological conditions,Two distinct loci on the short arm of chromosome 16 are involved in myeloid leukemia. We report a case of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) M5 with the characteristic t(8;16)(p11;p13). The breakpoint in the short arm was regionally localized using nonradioactive in situ hybridization with a series of cosmids of chromosome 16. The results show that a difference exists between the breakpoint in chromosome 16(p13) in this t(8;16) and the breakpoint involved in the short arm in the characteristic inversion 16 (p13;q22)) that occurs in ANLL M4eo. Two different loci appear to be involved in these chromosomal rearrangements. 
general pathological conditions,"Chronic upper lobe cavitary lung disease. Chronic upper lobe cavitary lung disease may be caused by infections, emphysema, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, sarcoidosis and rheumatologic syndromes. The diagnostic evaluation includes a complete history, a physical examination, a chest radiograph, and sputum examination and culture. In some cases, computed tomographic scanning and biopsy are required. "
general pathological conditions,"Managing prostatitis in the elderly. Bacterial prostatitis is primarily a disease of elderly men, and it is the most common urinary tract infection seen in this age group. Urosepsis from prostatitis or prostatic abscess occurs less frequently than with urological manipulation, but must always be considered in elderly men with prostatitis. This article focuses on the diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of bacterial prostatitis in the elderly. "
general pathological conditions,"Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome with oral hemangiomas. A case of blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome with oral hemangiomas is reported. Attention is directed to this syndrome because, although rare, it is usually associated with oral lesions. The blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome should always be considered a possibility in patients with oral hemangiomas and bluish skin nodules. "
general pathological conditions,"Infarct of the conus medullaris simulating a spinal cord tumor: case report. A 71-year-old woman had the sudden onset of a neurogenic bladder and a stepwise increase in paraparesis that left her unable to stand or walk. Magnetic resonance imaging showed what appeared to be a tumor in the conus medullaris. After laminectomy, the lesion was localized by ultrasound examination, and a biopsy was performed. The deficits remained unchanged postoperatively. Microscopic examination of the biopsy specimen showed necrosis and pathologic changes consistent with infarction of the conus medullaris. An anomalous arterial supply of the conus medullaris is the most likely cause of this unusual problem. The patient gradually regained her ability to walk, but the neurogenic bladder persists. "
general pathological conditions,"Late volume changes in retrosternal colon bypass. Esophageal obstruction by malignancy, chemical burns, or other less common entities presents a challenge for the surgeon. Either for esophageal substitution after esophageal resection or as a bypass for the obstructed esophagus, colon interposition is often the best available option. Massive colonic enlargement requiring resection of the interposed dilated colon developed recently in 2 of our patients who had a colon bypass 22 and 10 years earlier, respectively. "
general pathological conditions,"Jejunal-rectal fistula as a complication of postoperative radiotherapy. We present the case of a patient with an unusual, complex enteric fistula with multiple tracts and associated abscesses. The fistula was a late complication of radiotherapy, administered three years earlier, after resection for carcinoma of the sigmoid colon. Most of the small bowel was involved in the radiation-induced disease. A wide resection was performed successfully. This report reviews current literature on intra-abdominal postradiotherapy injuries, particularly intestinal fistulae. "
general pathological conditions,"Hamman-Rich syndrome revisited In this article, we retrospectively review 29 cases of Hamman-Rich syndrome. As in some other recent reports, we have used the term ""acute interstitial pneumonia"" to emphasize the clinical and pathologic features of these cases and to distinguish them from the more common chronic interstitial pneumonias, particularly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Of the 29 patients, 12 survived, some after a long and complicated hospitalization. The histologic features were those of organizing diffuse alveolar damage, and some patients, including survivors, had extensive fibroblastic distortion of lung parenchyma. The overall survival among these patients was not appreciably different from the survival of patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome in general. "
general pathological conditions,"Closure of leaking filtering blebs with cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive. Five leaking filtering blebs, occurring between 10 months and 21 years after trabeculectomy, were closed with cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive. Filtering bleb integrity was preserved in four cases, so that additional microsurgery was avoided. The only problem associated with use of tissue adhesive was the development of corneal abrasions in three cases. Although it is an accepted treatment for these conjunctival fistulas, only nine previous cases have been reported to our knowledge. We strongly recommend the use of tissue adhesive as a presurgical treatment in the management of leaking filtering blebs which present as a late postoperative complication of glaucoma surgery. "
general pathological conditions,"The importance of the GHQ in general practice. The relationship between General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) score and complaints presented at the general practitioners office was examined, and showed that the correlation between them is not as high as might be expected. Many patients who present psychosocial problems to their GP appear to have a low GHQ score; many patients with a high GHQ score exclusively present somatic complaints, which are also assessed by the GP as being purely somatic. Implications of the results are discussed. "
general pathological conditions,Pachyonychia congenita complicated by hidradenitis suppurativa: a family study. A family is described in which five of the six members with the Jackson-Lawler type of pachyonychia congenita also had varying degrees of hidradenitis suppurativa. We suggest an association between this type of pachyonychia congenita and hidradenitis suppurativa. 
general pathological conditions,Contrast venography in patients with very edematous feet: use of transdermal illumination to aid in vein puncture. Contrast venography can be technically difficult or impossible in patients with very edematous feet. The authors report a simple technique that uses transdermal illumination of the edematous subcutaneous tissue to enable visualization of a vein and also guide the needle into the vein. This technique has been used successfully in eight patients in whom conventional attempts at vein puncture had failed. 
general pathological conditions,"Drug fever. Remember to consider it in diagnosis. Drug fever should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient with unexplained fever. Clues in the history, physical examination, and laboratory assessment can point to the diagnosis before extensive, costly, and potentially harmful investigations and therapies are begun. "
general pathological conditions,"Intraoperative coronary angiography using fluorescein. Intraoperative coronary angiography using fluorescein was applied to evaluate the patency of saphenous vein grafts just after completion of the distal anastomosis. By this technique, the area of the revascularized myocardium was well estimated in real time. This intraoperative direct-vision examination gives us more timely and precise information during coronary artery bypass grafting. "
general pathological conditions,"Outcome of patients with chronic affective disorder: a five-year follow-up. Patients with major depression, mania, or schizo-affective disorder that had been present without remission for 2 years or more at intake (N = 129) were followed prospectively for 5 years, as were 580 patients who had been ill for shorter periods at intake. Despite very substantial durations of episode, three-quarters of the chronic patients recovered, although recovery occurred much later in the follow-up period than it did among the nonchronic patients. Factors associated with recovery were less severe illness at intake, lack of psychotic features, good friendship patterns in adolescence, and, most important, a relatively high maximum level of functioning in the 5 years preceding intake. "
general pathological conditions,"Persistent segmental cutaneous anesthesia after a brown recluse spider bite. Patients with brown recluse spider bites commonly suffer from pain, muscular aching, and a variety of local dysesthesias during the acute and resolution phases of toxin-induced injury. This is our first well-documented observation of persistent cutaneous anesthesia caused by a spider bite. The anesthetic area conformed to the distribution of a specific nerve, the transverse cervical cutaneous nerve. The identification of the spider as a brown recluse and the location of the bite over the nerve's usual pathway strongly suggest that the venom was responsible for this complication. "
general pathological conditions,"Potential role of IgG avidity for diagnosing toxoplasmosis. Sera from 20 cases of toxoplasmic lymphadenopathy were examined by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay toxoplasma IgG avidity (ELISA) at two laboratories. The results obtained were largely in agreement and showed that sera from patients with acute infection had low avidity IgG (30% or less), whereas sera from patients with chronic infection had high avidity IgG (40% or more). It is suggested that this type of assay could have a useful complementary role in antenatal testing for toxoplasmosis. "
general pathological conditions,"Hypothermia. Safe and efficient methods of rewarming the patient. Hypothermia, a relatively common problem in the winter months, can cause significant morbidity. It presents in a variety of situations and affects a wide age range. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, because the symptoms, which are primarily related to the central nervous system, are not distinctive. Appropriate management requires accurate measurement of core body temperature. Treatment is centered on rewarming the patient safely and efficiently while providing other supportive measures. Care should be taken to avoid arrhythmias. Simple precautions greatly reduce the risk of hypothermia. "
general pathological conditions,"Eleven years' experience with retinopathy of prematurity: visual results and contribution of cryoablation. We report our 11 years' experience of cryotherapy for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Charts of 624 infants weighing under 1250 g who were admitted to our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit during 1977-87 were reviewed. Three hundred and eighty nine babies survived, and the total ROP prevalence was 57.5%. Cryotherapy was applied to 35%. Only one case (0.25%) of blindness was detected, and four babies (1%) had a final visual acuity of less than 20/200 in one eye. The complication rate following cryoablation was very low. "
general pathological conditions,"Proximal femoral allografts in revision hip arthroplasty. We followed prospectively 69 patients with 78 proximal femoral allografts performed for revision of total hip arthroplasty for an average of 36 months (range 29 to 68). Large fragment proximal femoral allografts and cortical strut allografts were successful in 85%. Grafts smaller than 3 cm in length (calcar grafts) were clinically successful in 81%, but 50% underwent significant radiographic resorption. We conclude that large proximal femoral allografts and cortical strut allografts provide dependable reconstruction of bone stock deficiencies during revision total hip arthroplasty. "
general pathological conditions,"Avulsion of the rectus femoris tendon: an unusual type of pelvic fracture. We present the case of a 15-year-old boy evaluated in the emergency department after sustaining an acute hip injury during track and field practice. Pelvic radiograph demonstrated an avulsion fracture of the anterior inferior iliac spine. Review of the literature reveals this to be a well recognized, yet unusual and interesting injury. "
general pathological conditions,"Management of perineal wounds following abdominoperineal resection with inferior gluteal flaps. Our experience treating perineal wounds secondary to abdominoperineal resection, either for inflammatory bowel disease or cancer, is presented. A total of 16 patients were treated either on a delayed basis or at the same time as the abdominoperineal resection. All wounds were closed using the inferior gluteal myocutaneous flap. Fifteen of 16 patients have achieved healing, eight of whom had no complications. Only minor revisions or local wound care were required in the remaining patients, with only one patient failing to heal. Our results compare favorably with previous reports of treatment of this difficult problem. "
general pathological conditions,"Leukocyte larceny: spurious hypoxemia confirmed with pulse oximetry Leukemic patients with extremely high white blood counts may exhibit the phenomenon of leukocyte larceny, in which white blood cells metabolize plasma oxygen in arterial blood gas samples (ABG) producing a spuriously low oxygen tension. We report the case of a leukemic patient with a white blood count in excess of 500,000 in whom multiple ABGs documented hypoxemia out of proportion to his clinical picture. Pulse oximetry was used to confirm higher hemoglobin oxygen saturation to establish the leukocyte larceny. "
general pathological conditions,"Rare variant of isolated lower pole hydronephrosis: primary obstructive megaureter. Hydronephrosis in the lower pole moiety of a duplex system is relatively uncommon, usually associated with vesicoureteric reflux. We report on a patient with primary obstructive megaureter of a lower pole moiety that we believe is the first case report in the literature. "
general pathological conditions,"Intramyocardial shotgun pellets diagnosed on initial emergency room chest X-ray: case report. The diagnosis of retained intracardiac missile is usually made at thoracotomy or fluoroscopy. Close inspection of plain chest X-rays may reveal blurring of radiopaque objects that are moving with the beating heart. In a gunshot wound victim who is initially stable, observation of this phenomenon should prompt a very high index of suspicion for cardiac injury. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring is indicated, and thoracotomy should be performed if penetrating cardiac injury is confirmed. "
general pathological conditions,"Underlying illness associated with failure to thrive in breastfed infants. Over a four-year period in a suburban pediatric practice, 38 infants aged six months or less were identified with failure to thrive (FTT) while breast-feeding. In seven cases (18.4%), an associated organic illness was diagnosed. Only 2 of 28 breast-fed neonates (8%) were found to have FTT associated with another illness, as compared to 5 of 10 older infants (50%). Breast-fed infants with FTT, particularly those presenting after the first month of life, should be considered high risk for having other disease. Their clinical evaluation should include an appropriate search for organic illnesses. "
general pathological conditions,"Physical examination and echo Doppler study in the assessment of femoral arterial complications following cardiac catheterization. Femoral arterial complications following cardiac catheterization have been well recognized. The development of an inguinal mass in these patients can represent a simple hematoma, a pseudoaneurysm, or an arteriovenous fistula. The utility of the physical examination in diagnosing these complications was assessed by using the echo Doppler study for comparison. This study shows that any single clinical sign should not be used in isolation, but a constellation of physical findings can suggest the correct diagnosis. "
general pathological conditions,"Unusual presentation of recurrent Wegener's granulomatosis. A 65-year-old woman presented with recurrent Wegener's granulomatosis following two years of immunosuppressive therapy and three years of complete remission. At her initial presentation, she had a characteristic x-ray picture showing multiple nodules with total resolution of these findings at three months. Five years later, at the time of clinical relapse, her chest x-ray film showed bilateral diffuse infiltrative disease. This change in radiologic presentation upon relapse of Wegener's has not previously been reported. Other unusual features include diffuse infiltrates as the pulmonary presentation and the long interval between cessation of therapy and relapse. We review the radiologic manifestations of Wegener's granulomatosis. "
general pathological conditions,"Swan-Ganz catheter-induced massive hemoptysis and pulmonary artery false aneurysm. Swan-Ganz catheter-induced massive hemoptysis and later pulmonary artery false aneurysm occurred in a patient with prosthetic mitral regurgitation. This patient was successfully managed by double-lumen endotracheal intubation, control of pulmonary hypertension, reversal of anticoagulation, mitral valve re-replacement, and transcatheter embolization. The pertinent literature is reviewed. "
general pathological conditions,"Anorectal varices--their frequency in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. Anorectal varices in portal hypertension have been little studied: Seventy eight per cent of 72 patients with portal hypertension had anorectal varices shown at flexible sigmoidoscopy. Significantly more patients with noncirrhotic portal hypertension had these varices than patients with cirrhosis (89% v 56%, p less than 0.01). "
general pathological conditions,"Dominant negative regulation of the mouse alpha-fetoprotein gene in adult liver. Transcription of the mouse alpha-fetoprotein gene is activated in the developing fetal liver and gut and repressed in both tissues shortly after birth. With germline transformation in mice, a cis-acting element was identified upstream of the transcription initiation site of the alpha-fetoprotein gene that was responsible for repression of the gene in adult liver. This negative element acts as a repressor in a position-dependent manner. "
general pathological conditions,"Ptychotropism as a cutaneous feature of the CHILD syndrome. The hallmark of the CHILD syndrome is a unilateral ichthyosiform nevus that displays a pronounced affinity for the body folds. For this phenomenon the term ptychotropism is proposed. The expression is composed from the Greek words ptyche (fold) and trope (a turning). It is concluded that the cutaneous lesions of the CHILD nevus are determined by two factors, lyonization and ptychotropism. The phenomenon of ptychotropism constitutes an additional argument to distinguish the CHILD nevus from the inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus because the latter is not ptychotropic. "
general pathological conditions,"Ciliary motility in two patients with yellow nail syndrome and recurrent sinopulmonary infections. The yellow nail syndrome (YNS) is described as a combination of yellow nails, chronic lymphedema, pleural effusions, and recurrent sinopulmonary infections, but all these features need not be present for the diagnosis. The mechanism that renders patients with this syndrome susceptible to respiratory infections is not known. To determine whether abnormal ciliary motility is a predisposing factor, in vitro ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was measured in two patients with YNS and recurrent respiratory infections. In each case, the CBF was within normal limits (12 Hz). These data suggest that abnormal ciliary motility is not a pathophysiologic mechanism of recurrent sinopulmonary infections in YNS. "
general pathological conditions,"Arrhythmias in patients with CHF. Should they be treated? Ventricular arrhythmias are a major cause of death in patients with congestive heart failure. Dr Ellenbogen and his associates discuss the current thinking, based on recent studies, concerning use of antiarrhythmic agents to prevent sudden cardiac death in these patients. As they point out, the proper antiarrhythmic therapy may be crucial to long-term survival. "
general pathological conditions,"Chylothorax as presenting manifestation of adenocarcinoma with probable gastric primary. Chylothorax is an unusual complication of various malignant neoplasms, generally lymphomas. The few reported cases of chylothorax with gastric and other abdominal malignancies have involved large abdominal masses with prominent adenopathy and chylous ascites. We describe a patient in whom chylothorax was the presenting manifestation of an adenocarcinoma with probable gastric primary, developing prior to any clinical or radiologic evidence of tumor. "
general pathological conditions,"Myeloma of the head of the pancreas. A case report. A 45-year-old man was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, IgA-kappa, in 1975. Thirteen years later he presented with obstructive jaundice. Computed tomography (CT) showed a 6-cm mass in the head of the pancreas. Needle aspiration showed myeloma. The jaundice resolved after treatment with radiotherapy. Extraosseous involvement by myeloma is frequently found at autopsy but obstructive jaundice from myeloma of the head of the pancreas is quite rare. This atypical complication of myeloma may be related to the patient's long survival. "
general pathological conditions,"Isotretinoin for refractory lupus erythematosus. We describe six patients with cutaneous manifestations of lupus erythematosus who were treated with isotretinoin, 1 mg/kg/day. In each case the cutaneous lesions had proved resistant to systemic corticosteroids and antimalarial therapy. Treatment with isotretinoin resulted in rapid clinical improvement in all cases. Recurrences were similarly rapid when the drug was discontinued. Side effects were minimal and easily controlled by adjustments in dose or by the use of lubricants. "
general pathological conditions,"Bialaphos poisoning with apnea and metabolic acidosis. A 64-year-old man with ethanol intoxication, ingested a bottle of Herbiace (100 ml, 32 w/v% of bialaphos, CAS #35597-43-4, Meiji Seika Kaisha, Tokyo, Japan). He had severe metabolic acidosis and was treated with infusions of sodium bicarbonate and furosemide, plus gastric lavage and enema. The metabolic acidosis improved 15 hours after treatment but nystagmus, apnea and convulsions were progressive. Although his sensorium was clear, spontaneous respirations were not observed for 64 hours. The electroencephalographic findings of atypical triphasic waves and slow waves suggest a unique response to bialaphos poisoning. His clinical course indicates that the management of apnea is critically important to recovery from bialaphos poisoning. "
general pathological conditions,"Cyst of the choroid plexus in the lateral ventricle: case report and review of the literature. We report an intraventricular cyst in a 2-year-old boy who had myoclonic jerks of the extremities. The cyst had no communication with the ventricular system or subarachnoid space. Total removal of the cyst adhering to the choroid plexus was accomplished. The glial cyst wall was lined in part by flattened or cuboidal epithelium. The preoperative and postoperative computed tomographic scans and magnetic resonance images are presented, and congenital benign cysts in the lateral ventricle are reviewed and discussed. "
general pathological conditions,"Acute urinary retention in a child with appendiceal abscess: diagnostic dilemma. Rarely do children with appendiceal abscess present with acute urinary retention as the only sign or symptom. This presentation may delay diagnosis and definitive therapy, thereby causing additional morbidity and possible mortality. We report the eighth case of acute urinary retention in a child associated with an appendiceal abscess. "
general pathological conditions,"Delayed brachial artery occlusion owing to a dog bite of the upper extremity. We report a case of delayed presentation of vascular injury from a superficial dog bite of the upper extremity in a five-year-old male. This example of a significant arterial injury, in the setting of seemingly minor trauma, is the first known report of blunt arterial trauma owing to a dog bite in any age group. Blunt arterial trauma in children is rare unless associated with fractures, dislocations, or massive crush injuries. Additionally, persistent pulses following arterial occlusion are rare and can potentially lead to misdiagnosis of a serious arterial injury. A brief review of pediatric blunt vascular injuries is presented with implications for diagnosis and management of such cases. "
general pathological conditions,"Herpes simplex keratitis in renal transplant patients. Five out of 430 patients (1.16%) undergoing kidney transplantation developed an atypical clinical picture of herpetic dendritic keratitis within four weeks after surgery. It was manifested by multiple dendrites, located mainly in the corneal periphery or the limbus, developing in relatively uninflamed eyes. The response to acyclovir therapy was prolonged and took at least three weeks. Additionally, subepithelial infiltrates with ultimate scarring developed in all patients. Disciform keratopathy was not found. This clinical course is ascribed to the patients' immunosuppressed state. "
general pathological conditions,"Delayed-onset dystonia due to perinatal or early childhood asphyxia. We report 10 patients with delayed-onset dystonia associated with perinatal asphyxia and 2 associated with asphyxia in childhood. In the perinatal group, the mean age of onset was 12.9 years. Among these patients, dystonia continued to progress for a mean of 7 years, and as long as 28 years. These patients had moderate motor disability; none was wheelchair-bound, and thus their prognosis was better than that of the childhood-onset idiopathic torsion dystonias. The most frequently beneficial drugs were anticholinergics. Since some of these patients closely resembled cases of idiopathic torsion dystonia, the prior occurrence of asphyxia should be used as a criterion of exclusion for that diagnosis. "
general pathological conditions,"Developmental dysmnesia in a poor reader. A 22-yr-old subject with moderate developmental dyslexia experienced poor memory from an early age. In spite of normal intelligence he had great difficulty in learning historical and geographical names, mathematical formulae, poems and songs, and verbal series such as the letters of the alphabet and the months of the year. His recognition of familiar faces was also faulty at times. A battery of memory tests confirmed a moderate deficit of verbal as well as visual memory, whereas spatial memory was preserved. Other cognitive functions were intact, except for a mild reading disability. No evidence of brain pathology was provided by his history, neurological examination and CT scanning. "
general pathological conditions,"Referred pain of muscular origin resembling endodontic involvement. Case report. Referred pain is common in the orofacial region and can cause considerable difficulties in diagnosis. Referred pain is defined as pain that is referred to a part of the body other than the site of origin, and as a result, severe pain may arise without an associated causative lesion. A muscular trigger point that resembled a tooth with endodontic involvement is discussed. "
general pathological conditions,"Papillary endothelial hyperplasia in the thyroid following fine-needle aspiration. A 74-year-old woman was found to have exuberant papillary endothelial hyperplasia within her thyroid gland subsequent to multiple fine-needle aspiration biopsies of a Hurthle cell neoplasm. To our knowledge, this histologic alteration in the thyroid has not been previously reported. We describe this unusual complication following fine-needle aspiration, and we delineate the clinicopathologic and differential diagnostic features. "
general pathological conditions,"Application of INSTAT hemostat in the control of gingival hemorrhage in the patient with thrombocytopenia. A case report. Gingival bleeding in the patient with thrombocytopenia can be a difficult management problem. Primary therapy with platelet transfusions may not be sufficient to control the hemorrhage and adjunctive local therapy may be required. Currently, few local management techniques can effectively control this problem. INSTAT collagen absorbable hemostat can be used as a local adjunct with platelet transfusions and has certain application advantages over topical thrombin and microfibrillar collagen. Two successful techniques of INSTAT application to control gingival hemorrhage in a patient with severe thrombocytopenia in leukemic relapse are described. "
general pathological conditions,The radiologic morphology of painful temporomandibular joints. A high frequency of remodeling changes was demonstrated radiographically in a series of patients having pain in the temporomandibular joint region. Radiologic morphologic differences between painful and asymptomatic temporomandibular joints were in frequency rather than type. Caution should be taken not to overestimate the significance of radiologic abnormality in patients with pain in the temporomandibular joint region. 
general pathological conditions,Rupture of arteriovenous fistula after in situ saphenous vein bypass. Residual saphenous vein tributaries function as arteriovenous fistulas after in-situ lower extremity bypass. Whether or not all of these tributaries need to be ligated at the time of bypass is controversial since many will close spontaneously. Other consequences of retained fistulas range from local skin problems to diminished graft flow and ultimate graft thrombosis. A complication not previously reported is rupture of a retained arteriovenous fistula. This unusual and potentially catastrophic complication should be discoverable at an earlier stage by periodic graft surveillance by means of duplex sonography. The routine policy of selective ligation of saphenous vein tributaries needs to be reexamined. 
general pathological conditions,"Chronic urticaria exacerbated by the antioxidant food preservatives, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Two patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria in whom remissions were achieved with dye- and preservative-elimination diet had exacerbations of their urticaria when they were challenged under double-blind, placebo-controlled conditions with butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene. After elimination of butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene from their diets, there was marked abatement of the frequency, severity, and duration of their urticaria. These antioxidants appear capable of aggravating symptoms in certain patients with chronic urticaria. "
general pathological conditions,"Is fibrillation chaos? Ventricular fibrillation is examined to determine whether it is an instance of deterministic chaos. Surface ECGs from dogs in fibrillation were used to generate a state space representation of fibrillation. Our analysis failed to identify a low-dimensional attractor that could be associated with fibrillation. The results suggest that fibrillation is similar to a nonchaotic random signal. We note, however, that such random-looking but nonchaotic behavior can also be generated by a nonlinear deterministic system. "
general pathological conditions,"Mortality in hereditary antithrombin-III deficiency--1830 to 1989 To determine whether antithrombin-III (AT-III) deficiency leads to an excess mortality, we studied 171 individuals from ten families with a proven hereditary deficiency. 73 were classified as certainly deficient either by direct measurement of AT-III concentration or by mendelian inheritance patterns. 98 individuals had a high probability (0.5) of deficiency. The 64 deaths recorded did not exceed those expected for the general population adjusted for age, sex, and calendar period. We suggest that a policy of prophylactic anticoagulation for patients with AT-III deficiency cannot be recommended. "
general pathological conditions,"Cruciate paralysis: a clinical and radiographic analysis of injuries to the cervicomedullary junction. Fourteen patients with superior cervical spinal cord injuries and the clinical signs and symptoms of cruciate paralysis are presented. This rare injury pattern is characterized by weakness of the upper extremities with little or no compromise of lower-extremity function following trauma to the superior spinal cord. Anatomically, cruciate paralysis is thought to represent selective injury to descending corticospinal tracts as they decussate at the cervicomedullary junction. The clinical and radiographic findings of each patient are outlined and the incidence and natural history of the injury syndrome, including a review of the literature, are presented. "
general pathological conditions,"Hemifacial spasm in Rochester and Olmsted County, Minnesota, 1960 to 1984. The incidence of hemifacial spasm in residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, was studied by reviewing the medical records of patients residing in the community between 1960 and 1984. The average annual incidence rate was 0.74 per 100,000 in men and 0.81 per 100,000 in women, age-adjusted to the 1970 US white population. The average prevalence rate was 7.4 per 100,000 population in men and 14.5 per 100,000 in women. The incidence and prevalence rates were highest in those from 40 to 79 years of age. "
general pathological conditions,Bilateral infrapatellar tendon rupture in a patient with jumper's knee. This is the fourth case report of bilateral infrapatellar tendon rupture as a result of indirect trauma in a patient without systemic disease. This is the only report we have found of jumper's knee leading to simultaneous infrapatellar tendon ruptures. 
general pathological conditions,"Takayasu's disease with axillary, right coronary artery, and right internal mammary stenosis treated with angioplasty. A 47-year-old woman presented with progressive angina and failed medical therapy. After an unsuccessful attempt at angioplasty of a totally occluded right coronary artery, coronary artery bypass using the right internal mammary artery was performed. She presented 2 years later with stenosis in the mammary graft, right coronary artery, and axillary artery. These lesions were all treated with angioplasty. "
general pathological conditions,"Augmentation mammaplasty by means of the transrectus route. A new operative technique has been developed for augmentation mammaplasty. Through an inframammary incision, the anterior rectus sheath is entered, and the pocket is dissected in an entirely submuscular plane. We have performed this procedure in 112 patients to date. Complications have been few. The capsular contracture rate in 90 patients followed for greater than 1 year is 7 percent. The inframammary crease can be lowered using this technique, making mastopexy unnecessary in most patients with moderate ptosis. "
general pathological conditions,"Anterior femoral cutaneous nerve injury following femoral artery reconstructive surgery. Two cases are presented exhibiting symptoms and signs of bilateral anterior femoral cutaneous nerve injury, clinically sparing femoral nerve branches to the saphenous nerve and quadriceps muscles. This occurred following surgical dissection in the femoral triangles associated with femoral artery reconstructive surgery. Anterior femoral cutaneous nerve injury should be considered when anterior medial thigh pain and numbness occur following aortofemoral bypass graft surgery and other types of femoral artery reconstructive surgery. "
general pathological conditions,Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm complicating mitral valve replacement in a 4-year-old child with acute bacterial endocarditis. A 4-year-old child with acute bacterial endocarditis required mitral valve replacement. A left ventricular pseudoaneurysm developed following surgery. The etiology and diagnosis of this complication are discussed. 
general pathological conditions,"Polyglucosan body disease. Adult polyglucosan disease has been described in 15 cases. All had signs of peripheral neuropathy, upper motor neuron signs, and 12 of the 15 had sphincter problems. Dementia was prominent in 8 of 15 cases. We reported 2 cases that contained these clinical features. Electrophysiological studies showed axonal neuropathy. Somatosensory evoked potentials on the second patient were abnormal. Sural nerve biopsy showed clusters of polyglucosan bodies. Although the presence of polyglucosan bodies in biopsy is nonspecific, the number as well as the clinical features are necessary to make the diagnosis. Branching enzyme activity in muscle extracts of the muscles were normal. Hence, a specific enzyme abnormality is not yet known. "
general pathological conditions,Rupture of a benign mediastinal teratoma into the right pleural cavity. A 27-year-old woman with a ruptured mediastinal cystic teratoma had high levels of amylase and carcinoembryonic antigen in cystic fluid. The activity of the amylase is thought to be the most likely cause of the rupture. High levels of carcinoembryonic antigen in pleural fluid are not necessarily indicative of a malignant lesion but may suggest the presence of a ruptured teratoma in patients with mediastinal tumors. 
general pathological conditions,"Synchronous diffuse well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma and gastric adenocarcinoma presenting as splenomegaly and iron deficiency anemia. Diffuse well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma (D-WDLL) and chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) represent closely related neoplasms which may have indolent courses. Dating back more than one century, reports of associated second primary malignancies continue to intrigue clinicians. A case of synchronous D-WDLL and gastric adenocarcinoma, presenting as splenomegaly and iron deficiency anemia, is presented. The case and literature are reviewed. "
general pathological conditions,Embolism during caesarean section. We investigated the occurrence of gas embolism during Caesarean section using a Doppler ultrasound probe and found that it occurs between uterine incision and delivery. Embolism is less common during general anaesthesia than has been reported during regional anaesthesia. Both ruptured membranes and a protracted uterine incision to delivery interval predispose to embolism. 
general pathological conditions,"Morbidity associated with incompletely erupted third molars in the line of mandibular fractures. A retrospective analysis of 105 mandibular fractures associated with incompletely erupted third molars was undertaken. It was found that there was no difference in the rates of complication if the teeth were retained or extracted, or if an open or closed reduction was performed. The combination of tooth retention with open reduction, however, shows a trend toward being the treatment most prone to postoperative complications. "
general pathological conditions,"The neurologic workup in patients with cervical spine disorders. Care must be exercised in interpreting the clinical and radiologic findings when assessing patients with cervical spondylosis and involvement of neural structures for surgery. If the clinical picture cannot logically be explained by the radiologic findings, further investigation is indicated to exclude a coexistent disorder. Investigations may include electrophysiologic tests, transcranial magnetic stimulation, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Only then can the indication for surgical intervention be properly determined. "
general pathological conditions,Total left main coronary artery occlusion after aortic aneurysm repair and valve replacement. A 38-year-old woman with complete occlusion of the left main coronary artery secondary to cannulation during aortic valve replacement is presented. The clinical course was characterized by progressive left ventricular dysfunction and congestive heart failure. Recognition of this potential problem when it occurs is important as to institute therapeutic measures which may interrupt a patient's progressive clinical deterioration. 
general pathological conditions,Coronary artery fistula formation secondary to permanent pacemaker placement. We present the findings in two patients who apparently developed a coronary artery fistula as a complication of an endocardial pacing electrode. This complication may actually be occurring more frequently than recognized because the patient may be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and therefore not undergo a coronary angiogram. Awareness of this potentially serious complication is important and stresses the need for proper electrode placement without excess pressure on the tip. 
general pathological conditions,"Cardiac conducting tissue. A simplified technique for examination of the SA and AV nodes. We describe a modified method for examination of the atrioventricular and sinoatrial nodes that displays the major elements of the cardiac conducting system, yet is not time-consuming for the technician. We examined 31 cases in three categories: cases with previous cardiac history, sudden deaths from no known cause, and cases where death was sudden and accidental. All cases showed histologic abnormalities in the cardiac tissue. We contend that our method would permit such examination to be routinely used in the pathology laboratory. "
general pathological conditions,"Tuberothalamic infarct after division of a hypoplastic posterior communicating artery for clipping of a basilar tip aneurysm: case report. The authors present a case of a tuberothalamic infarct subsequent to division of the posterior communicating artery for clipping of a high-lying aneurysm of the basilar bifurcation using the pterional approach. In view of this clinical observation and some particular aspects of the microsurgical anatomy of the perforating vessels of the posterior communicating artery, we conclude that interrupting this parent vessel carries a significant risk of infarction. "
general pathological conditions,"Aminocaproic acid prophylaxis in traumatic hyphema. Oral aminocaproic acid has been shown to be effective in clot stabilization and in the reduction of secondary bleeding rates in cases of traumatic hyphema. In a retrospective study of 105 patients treated during a 1-year period, we found the incidence of rebleeding in patients with traumatic hyphema who received aminocaproic acid prophylaxis was 2%; the incidence in those who did not was 25%. "
general pathological conditions,"A syndrome characterized by nodular eosinophilic infiltration of the skin and immunoglobulin isotype imbalance. A 9-year-old boy had recurrent acute, plaquelike, nodular infiltrations with overlying vesicles and bullae of the face and right hand. Histologically, the lesions consisted of a perivascular and periadnexal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with many eosinophils. The lesions responded to dapsone therapy. Laboratory studies revealed blood eosinophilia, hyperimmunoglobulinemias E and G4, and hypoimmunoglobulinemias M and G1-3, which normalized after treatment. The patient's immune deviation is consistent with a transient imbalance of lymphokine production in helper T cells. "
general pathological conditions,"The infant with a reddish diaper. The infant with a reddish diaper presents a diagnostic challenge to the primary care physician. As described by Dr Baumgardner, the cause may be benign, but more ominous disorders must be ruled out. "
general pathological conditions,Electrocardiographic abnormalities in cerebrovascular accidents. The electrocardiographic abnormalities found in 100 patients with acute cerebrovascular disease and previously normal hearts are described. The abnormalities were more often seen in patients with intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhages. The most common changes were Q-Tc Prolongation and ST segment and T wave abnormalities. The mechanisms of these electrocardiographic abnormalities appear to be multiple. 
general pathological conditions,"Ritual and dying: a cultural analysis of social support for caregivers. This study examines the role of social support in the process of caring for someone dying at home. Based on data from in-depth ethnographic interviews with 16 caregivers, it employs a cultural analysis to draw parallels with rituals of transition. Ritual provides a broad context of meanings and routines for securing the doubts and unknowns of individual experience. The way social support is provided plays a key role in the caregiver's transition to bereavement. "
general pathological conditions,"Propranolol and the morning increase in sudden cardiac death: (the beta-blocker heart attack trial experience). To provide insight into the protective effect of propranolol on mortality after myocardial infarction observed in the beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial, the time of occurrence of sudden cardiac death was examined in this population. Between 5 A.M. and 11 A.M., 25 of the 56 total deaths (38%) occurred in the placebo patients compared with 11 of 45 (24%) in the propranolol patients. Excluding this period, there were nearly equal numbers of sudden cardiac deaths in the propranolol and placebo groups. This retrospective analysis suggests that beta blockade is protective during the morning hours when a surge of sympathetic activity may increase the risk of sudden cardiac death. "
general pathological conditions,"Lack of late skin necrosis in man after high-dose irradiation using small field sizes: experiences of grid therapy. Out of a total of 437 patients with superior vena caval syndrome or advanced malignancy, given single-dose grid radiotherapy, four survived to 7 years. The dose to the skin under each of the 77 holes in the grid was approximately 58 Gy. The lack of skin necrosis in the total of 308 skin circles of 1 cm diameter among these survivors, compared with known necrosis rates in larger irradiated areas, implies that there is a marked field-size effect for late necrosis in small areas of irradiated skin. "
general pathological conditions,"Late luteal phase dysphoric disorder in young women. The authors determined the prevalence of late luteal phase dysphoric disorder in 217 university women aged 17-29 years. Unaware of the focus on premenstrual syndrome (PMS), the participants rated DSM-III-R symptoms of late luteal phase dysphoric disorder over 90 days. Using a 30% or greater premenstrual change as an index of luteal variation, the authors found that 10 women (4.6%) met the symptom criteria during two menstrual cycles. Compared to 25 young women seeking treatment for PMS who met the same diagnostic criteria, the 10 women from the university sample reported significantly less fatigue and impaired concentration and somewhat less severe depression and overall symptoms. "
general pathological conditions,"Echographic diagnosis of dural carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas. I used standardized ophthalmic echography to identify specific abnormalities in four patients with low-pressure, low-flow dural arteriovenous malformations. In all of the patients, B-scan ultrasonography showed engorgement of the ipsilateral vertical vein. A-scan ultrasonography dynamically imaged rapid blood flow through the superior ophthalmic vein and enlargement of the culpable ocular muscles in patients with restrictive ophthalmopathy. The 30-degree test distinguished between venous engorgement of the optic nerve sheath and apical compression of the optic nerve by enlarged ocular muscles. "
general pathological conditions,"Rheumatoid arthritis and comorbidity. Data collected from 288 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) indicated that 54% of respondents also reported other chronic conditions, and that 20% rated at least one of these other conditions as severe. Both the frequency and severity of these comorbidities affected scores on measures of depressive symptoms, social connectedness and on the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales. These findings suggest that the absence of controls for comorbidity may bias measures of functional status among patients with RA. "
general pathological conditions,"Computerized tomography in acute gastrointestinal disorders. In recent years, computerized tomography (CT) has become one of the most important imaging modalities in evaluation of patients with acute gastrointestinal disorders. Its role, diagnostic accuracy, indications, and limitations in some of the most commonly encountered acute abdominal conditions are succinctly presented and reviewed. CT should not be used indiscriminantly, but is best considered a valuable primary or complimentary diagnostic tool in critically ill patients. Its selective use in a variety of emergency abdominal diseases will significantly improve accuracy of clinical diagnoses, leading to a prompt and adequate medical or surgical management. "
general pathological conditions,"Temporary cardiac pacing using a new, steerable, balloon-tipped pacing catheter. A new balloon-tipped, flow-directed, steerable pacing catheter for unipolar temporary ventricular pacing is presented. It was successfully and uneventfully tested in 25 patients with acute myocardial infarction in the coronary care unit. The main advantage of the new catheter is the ease with which a stable contact may be achieved between the pacing electrode and the endocardium. "
general pathological conditions,"Benign thyroid hyperplasia presenting as bilateral vocal cord paralysis. Complete remission following surgery. A 52-year-old woman developed respiratory arrest on two separate occasions that required mechanical ventilation. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy demonstrated bilateral vocal cord paralysis, and a CT scan of the neck demonstrated a right neck mass. On surgical exploration, the mass was found extending from the thyroid gland and was identified as benign thyroid tissue. Thyroid hyperplasia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of bilateral vocal cord paralysis. "
general pathological conditions,"Radiographic detection of recurrent carious lesions associated with composite restorations. The greatest potential problem associated with posterior composite restoration is secondary caries detection. It is essential that secondary caries is detected as early as possible to enhance the prognosis for a successful treatment outcome. This laboratory study evaluated the optimum level of radiopacity of composite materials for radiographic detection of secondary carious lesions associated with composite materials. Results indicated that for the radiologic detection of secondary caries, it is sufficient for composite materials to have the same level of radiopacity as enamel. "
general pathological conditions,"Gastroesophageal reflux and sclerotherapy strictures. The development of esophageal stricture is common following endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy (EVS). Gastroesophageal reflux may be at least partly responsible. Twelve randomly selected male patients underwent chronic EVS for the management of bleeding esophageal varices. Six patients developed strictures during or after EVS, six did not. There were no significant differences between stricture and nonstricture patients during 24 hour esophageal pH monitoring. Three of the six stricture patients and four of the six nonstricture patients had an abnormal amount of reflux. Gastroesophageal reflux occurs frequently in patients undergoing EVS, and it is not likely to play a major role in EVS stricture formation. "
general pathological conditions,"The use of a tourniquet when plating tibial fractures. Sixty closed fractures of the tibia were treated by open reduction and internal fixation with plates and screws. Half the operations were performed with a thigh tourniquet and half without. In the tourniquet group, there were six cases with erythema and induration of the wound; in the other group there were no such complications. Despite negative bacterial cultures, superficial infection of the inflamed wounds was suspected. It is suggested that a tourniquet may predispose tissues to infection, and its use is not recommended during operations for internal fixation of the tibia. "
general pathological conditions,"Cecal diverticulitis presented as a cecal tumor. Seven patients diagnosed as having acute appendicitis were operated on and a cecal wall mass due to cecal diverticulitis was found. In two patients the mass could not be separated from the cecal wall and right colectomy was performed. In five patients, in whom the mass could be separated from the cecum, conservative operations (three diverticulectomies and two wedge resections) were performed, thus avoiding needless, more extensive surgery. "
general pathological conditions,"Bone marrow necrosis in leukemic-phase follicular lymphoma. Bone marrow necrosis has been regarded as a rare entity in specimens obtained from living patients and has been associated with a poor prognosis. It is most commonly found in patients with neoplastic disorders, severe infections, and sickle cell anemia. We present an unusual case of a small-cleaved type follicular lymphoma associated with bone marrow necrosis and a leukemic phase occurring in a 55-year-old woman. Specimens were studied by morphologic, immunohistochemical, cytogenetic, and DNA hybridization techniques. "
general pathological conditions,Benign thyroid adenoma causing recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy in a child. The standard teaching is that only malignant thyroid masses produce recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. An unusual exception to this rule is reported. 
general pathological conditions,"Poisoning with equine phenylbutazone in a racetrack worker. Phenylbutazone is a potent nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drug often used by veterinarians to treat racetrack animals. Its use in human beings is limited because of significant adverse effects and the availability of newer, safer drugs. We report the case of a 24-year-old man who ingested 17 g of equine phenylbutazone over a 24-hour period to treat the pain of a toothache. He developed grand mal seizures, coma, hypotension, respiratory and renal failure, and hepatic injury. Serum phenylbutazone concentration obtained approximately eight hours after presentation was 900 micrograms/mL. The patient recovered during six weeks of intensive supportive care and repeated hemodialysis. "
general pathological conditions,"Microsurgical epididymovasostomy by tubule intussusception: a new technique in rat model. This experimental study on 15 adult male rats with bilateral epididymovasostomies evaluates a new technique of tubule intussusception as an improved form of end-to-end anastomosis. This paper describes in detail the steps in this technique and offers physiological, anatomical, and histological follow-up after 3 months. With this technique there is a 97% patency rate and a 23.3% incidence of macroscopic spermatic granuloma. Complications are discussed in detail. "
general pathological conditions,"Risk factors for transmission of hepatitis B virus to Gambian children [published erratum appears in Lancet 1990 Dec 22-29;336(8730):1596] Risk factors for hepatitis B virus transmission were examined in 973 Gambian children aged 6 months to 5 years. 33% had evidence of infection with hepatitis B virus and a third of these were carriers. A significant association was found between infection and tropical ulcer scars, and between e antigenaemia and the presence of bedbugs in each child's bed. There was no association between infection and traditional scarring, circumcision, or injections. Skin disease and arthropods are the two most likely modes of transmission of hepatitis B virus between children in West Africa. "
general pathological conditions,"Behavioral management of psychogenic cough: alternative to the ""bedsheet"" and other aversive techniques. The treatment of persistent psychogenic cough, a potentially debilitating condition among pediatric patients, can pose diagnostic and treatment dilemmas. Its treatment by the use of a procedure called reinforced suggestion technique was described previously. The use of an alternative procedure relying upon parental and self-monitoring of coughing and either social or material rewards for decreasing rates of coughing is presented. "
general pathological conditions,"Total perinatal wastage. A clarification of priorities. The pregnancy outcome of 16,971 women carrying 17,352 living fetuses after 16 weeks gestation was studied. As well as recording perinatal deaths, all losses before 28 weeks and up to one year after delivery were recorded to give a total perinatal wastage rate of 21.6 per 1000 fetuses alive at 16 weeks compared with a perinatal mortality rate (stillbirths plus early neonatal deaths) of 7.8 per 1000 births. All deaths were then classified according to pathological sub-groups. The concept of auditing perinatal care using perinatal mortality was then compared with that using total perinatal wastage. "
general pathological conditions,"Femur fracture with limb shortening causing occlusion of a polytetrafluoroethylene femoral popliteal graft. Traumatic occlusion of lower extremity polytetrafluoroethylene arterial grafts is exceedingly rare. We report a patient who suffered a supracondylar femur fracture resulting in shortening of her right lower extremity with kinking and thrombosis of her above-knee polytetrafluoroethylene arterial graft. This is the first report in the English language of prosthetic graft occlusion as a result of traumatic limb shortening. The graft thrombus was successfully lysed by use of intraarterial urokinase, and the kink was repaired by graft resection and reanastomosis. The mechanism of injury and treatment are discussed. "
general pathological conditions,"Emergency center ultrasonography in the evaluation of hemoperitoneum: a prospective study. The reliability of ultrasonographic detection (US) of hemoperitoneum in blunt abdominal trauma was evaluated in a prospective study of 72 patients. Independent of the examiner, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were, respectively, 86.7%, 100%, and 97.2%. Laparotomy was indicated in 76.9% of US hemoperitoneum-positive cases. No negative laparotomies were performed in this study group. If hemoperitoneum is revealed in US and vital signs are unstable, we think laparotomy is indicated. We believe that US in an emergency center is a quick, safe screening method in the evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma. US might take over a great part of the role of diagnostic peritoneal lavage. "
general pathological conditions,Retroperitoneal air after routine hemorrhoidectomy. Report of a case. Retroperitoneal air as a complication after routine hemorrhoidectomy has not been reported in the literature. This occurred recently after hemorrhoidectomy in a 34-year-old patient receiving glucocorticoid therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Adverse steroidal effects of wound healing have been well documented. It is believed that steroid-induced tissue changes contributed to the development of this unique complication. 
general pathological conditions,"An all-polyethylene cementless tibial component. A five- to nine-year follow-up study. An all-polyethylene cementless tibial component was used in 221 total knee arthroplasties. With one exception, failures did not occur before three years. Failure was characterized by medial subsidence of the tibial component. There was abrasion of the polyethylene on the undersurface of all components that failed. Survivorship was seven to nine years (87.1%). This study demonstrated that a flexible cementless component can function well when used with any type of bone. However, abrasion of the polyethylene that occurs from shearing forces is a concern. Polyethylene components need adequate provisions to prevent shearing or need surface treatment to prevent abrasion. "
general pathological conditions,"Transient cyst-like cortical defects following fractures in children. Medullary fat within the subperiosteal haematoma. Asymptomatic cyst-like cortical defects appearing after fractures in children have been occasionally reported. Typically, these defects appear during fracture consolidation, within the newly formed subperiosteal bone, proximal to the fracture line, do not enlarge, and progressively disappear. We have previously shown a fatty density on CT scan within the early cortical defect. We now present two additional cases in which early CT scans appeared to confirm that these transient cortical defects may consist of fat, and probably result from the inclusion of medullary fat within the subperiosteal haematoma. "
general pathological conditions,"Porcelain and resin veneers clinically evaluated: 2-year results. A clinical comparison of two different types of dental veneers--baked porcelain veneer and heat-and-pressure processed urethane resin veneer--was made after 2 years. Although the esthetic appearance and gingival response were equal for both systems, the resin veneers had a greater tendency to chip and fracture. By the end of 2 years, 20% of the resin veneers had failed, whereas all of the porcelain veneers remained. "
general pathological conditions,"Eosinophilic meningitis: cause of a chronic pain syndrome. Three tourists developed eosinophilic meningitis after visiting the Fijian Islands. Two had a severe and long lasting illness with chronic intractable pain. In one patient electrophysiological studies and MRI scan of the brain were abnormal and provided evidence of both radicular and cerebral parenchymal involvement by the most likely causative agent, Angiostrongylus cantonensis. "
general pathological conditions,"Recurrent peripheral facial nerve palsy after dental procedures. Peripheral facial palsy is an uncommon complication of dental procedures. Most cases begin immediately after dental anesthesia and resolve within 12 hours. No report of recurrent facial palsy with dental manipulations has previously been described. We report a patient with two episodes of peripheral facial palsy, 2 years apart, developing within 24 hours of dental procedures. A third episode of contralateral facial weakness developed 3 years after the second event. This event was not related to dental manipulations. Although the exact mechanism is not known, dental manipulations may rarely result in precipitation of recurrent Bell's palsy. "
general pathological conditions,"Hyperfunctioning metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma in Pendred's syndrome. A 66-year-old woman with Pendred's syndrome underwent a partial thyroidectomy when she was 17 years old. At the age of 52 years, she had a second thyroid operation because of hyperthyroidism due to a toxic multinodular goiter with a mediastinal extension consisting of several separate nodules. Five years later a hyperfunctioning metastatic follicular carcinoma was diagnosed histologically. After treatment with radioactive iodine, the patient was well. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first description of a metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma in Pendred's syndrome and the first report of hyperthyroidism occurring after malignant degeneration of a dyshormonogenetic goiter. "
general pathological conditions,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: report of 82 cases. In our initial experience with 82 patients, laparoscopic cholecystectomy has shown numerous advantages over open cholecystectomy. Both intraoperative blood loss and postoperative need for pain medication have been minimal. Most patients were discharged within 24 to 36 hours and resumed normal activities within 3 to 5 days. The aesthetic aspect is also an obvious advantage, since the laparoscopic procedure avoids disfiguring abdominal scars. Previous abdominal surgery is not a contraindication to attempting this procedure. Based on our experience, laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be done safely on most patients who are candidates for open cholecystectomy, including the elderly, the obese, and those with acute gangrenous cholecystitis. "
general pathological conditions,"Lymphoedema/hypercalcaemia syndrome mediated by parathyroid-hormone-related protein. A 24-year-old woman presented with a cryptogenic, hypercalcaemic syndrome with metastatic pulmonary calcification and leg and massive breast enlargement and bilateral chylous pleural effusions compatible with a generalised lymphatic abnormality. The patient's serum parathyroid hormone-related protein concentration was very high at a time when she was significantly hypercalcaemic, implying that the hypercalcaemia was mediated by this protein. "
general pathological conditions,Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting oedema in young adults: a subset of rheumatoid arthritis or a distinct syndrome? Three young adult patients with seronegative symmetrical polysynovitis affecting the peripheral joints with pitting oedema of both dorsum of hands and feet are described. All of these patients had a benign course and resolved completely within 10-15 months of the onset. None developed any deformities or erosions and/or relapse of arthritis after prolonged follow-up. 
general pathological conditions,"Monosomy 22 in rhabdoid or atypical tumors of the brain. Cytogenetic studies of three rare childhood brain tumors were performed. Two children presented with pure rhabdoid tumors. The third child had a tumor composed of a mixture of rhabdoid elements with neuroepithelial, epithelial, and mesenchymal tissue - an atypical teratoid tumor. All three tumors demonstrated monosomy 22 as the only cytogenetic abnormality. The cytogenetic findings suggest that loss of a gene or genes on chromosome 22 may be involved in the initiation or progression of these malignant tumors. Further studies on additional fresh tumor specimens are warranted; however, it is possible that cytogenetic studies may be used as an additional means of diagnosing rhabdoid or atypical teratoid tumors of the brain. "
general pathological conditions,"Outpatient management of burns in children. The majority of burn wound management can be performed on an outpatient basis by the primary care physician or emergency physician. The physician, however, needs to know when to refer the patient for surgical evaluation and must be reasonably certain that the family will be compliant with wound care and follow-up. Fire prevention counselling still remains one of the most important aspects of burn management. "
general pathological conditions,Colonoscopy during an attack of severe ulcerative colitis is a safe procedure and of great value in clinical decision making. Thirty-four patients who had severe ulcerative colitis had a colonoscopic examination during the attack. The indications were resistance to therapy and/or differential diagnostic purposes. Total colonoscopy was performed in 25 cases and less extensive examination in nine. Biopsy was taken in 22 cases. No clinically significant complications occurred. The procedure helped us to postpone immediate surgical intervention in 19 cases. Fourteen of these patients have maintenance treatment and are still well after a follow-up median time of 5 yr (6 months to 10 yr). 
general pathological conditions,"Successful treatment of an excimer laser-associated coronary artery perforation with the Stack perfusion catheter. A 64-year-old woman underwent excimer laser angioplasty of the right coronary artery. The procedure was complicated by perforation, which was successfully managed without complication with a Stack perfusion catheter. This report describes successful nonsurgical treatment of laser-induced coronary perforation and makes recommendations for avoiding this complication in other patients. "
general pathological conditions,"Extrageniculate vision in hemianopic humans: saccade inhibition by signals in the blind field. The functional competence of extrageniculate visual pathways in hemianopic humans was demonstrated by showing that distractor signals in the blind half of the visual field could inhibit saccades toward targets in the intact visual field. This inhibitory effect of unseen distractors in patients occurred only when distractors were presented in the temporal half of the visual field, was specific to oculomotor responses, and did not occur in normal subjects. These results show that a peripheral visual signal activates retinotectal pathways to prime the oculomotor system and that these pathways can mediate orienting behavior in hemianopic humans. "
general pathological conditions,"Sweet's syndrome with lung involvement. Severe dyspnea and pulmonary infiltrates were associated with recurrent episodes of Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) in a 54-yr-old woman with myelodysplasia. Lung and skin biopsies revealed a sterile infiltration of the interstitial tissues by mature neutrophils. Corticosteroid therapy resulted in rapid clinical improvement; however, recurrent episodes were increasingly resistant to therapy, and she ultimately died from respiratory failure. Sweet's syndrome involving the lung is rare, with only two previously reported cases documented by lung biopsy. Prompt recognition of Sweet's syndrome with lung involvement is important because of the potential for severe respiratory compromise. "
general pathological conditions,"Brain abscess associated with congenital pulmonary arteriovenous fistula. A case of brain abscess associated with congenital pulmonary arteriovenous fistula was presented and 52 reported cases were reviewed. The brain abscess was successfully treated with repeated aspiration and drainage, and the pulmonary arteriovenous fistula, located in the right lower lobe, was resected. The arteriovenous fistula occurs as a common pulmonary manifestation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia; however, no symptoms suggesting these two were noted in this case. Brain abscesses can be an initial clinical manifestation in asymptomatic pulmonary arteriovenous fistula. This possible association should be borne in mind in cases of brain abscesses of unexplained etiology. "
general pathological conditions,"Evaluating hematuria in children. Where to start and how to proceed. Bleeding from somewhere along the urinary tract is not unusual in children. Of the many causes, systemic infection and trauma are among the most common. History taking and physical examination should be careful and complete, because the results obtained help direct the laboratory evaluation. Diagnostic testing always begins with urinalysis but may progress to intravenous urography, voiding cystourethrography, endoscopic procedures in the upper and lower urinary tract, sonography, arteriography, or renal biopsy. Some cases remain unexplained and require follow-up to assess renal function. "
general pathological conditions,"Severe anaphylactoid reaction to hydroxyethyl starch. A case is presented of a severe anaphylactoid reaction to hydroxyethyl starch solution that occurred peri-operatively and required extended intensive management of the resultant bronchospasm and hypotension. Subsequent intradermal injection of hetastarch produced a delayed positive response, suggestive of a complement-mediated mechanism. "
general pathological conditions,"The surgical treatment of ingrowing toenails. Two prospective studies of ingrowing toenail management were conducted. In the first, 163 patients (204 ingrowing nail edges) who had not had previous surgery were randomised and treated by total nail avulsion, nail edge excision, or nail edge excision with phenolisation of the germinal matrix; recurrence rates one year postoperatively were 73%, 73% and 9% respectively. In the second study, 63 ingrowing nail edges which had recurred after previous operations underwent nail edge excision and phenolisation. There was a 5% recurrence rate and 5% incidence of dystrophy of the nail one year after operation. "
general pathological conditions,"Whither short-course chemotherapy for tuberculous meningitis? Short-course chemotherapy is well established for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis but not for extrapulmonary disease. We present a series of 35 cases in which chemotherapy for tuberculous meningitis was given for a period of less than 2 years. Short-term therapy was associated with recrudescence of tuberculous meningitis and, in some cases, with the development of deep cerebral infarcts and permanent neurological deficits. We think short-term chemotherapy for tuberculosis of the central nervous system is inadequate. "
general pathological conditions,"Genetics of cerebrovascular disease. Stroke is a complex disease, with both genetic and environmental factors having a role in its pathogenesis. A review of past studies shows some evidence of genetic influences in the development of stroke. This is supported by studies of cardiovascular disease, which indicate major genetic influences at several levels including the development of risk factors. New approaches to phenotypic classifications, patient ascertainment, and genetic analysis will stimulate research into the role of genetics in cerebrovascular disease. "
general pathological conditions,"Atonic pupil: an unusual complication of cataract surgery. Eight cases of atonic pupil, an unusual complication following cataract surgery, are presented. Six of the eyes involved had intracapsular cataract extraction and anterior chamber intraocular lens implantation; one case underwent extracapsular cataract extraction with a posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation; the other had an extracapsular procedure with no implant. The etiology is unknown, but we believe the most likely one is that the sodium hyaluronate used in all these patients caused a temporary reduction of the iris blood supply by mechanical factors or by a vasoconstriction induced by some toxicity of the material that produced a lesion on the iris sphincter. "
general pathological conditions,"Bacteriologic findings with ectopic pregnancy. The fallopian tubes and peritoneum of 27 patients were cultured at the time of salpingotomy/salpingectomy to determine if active tubal infection was the cause of post-operative temperature elevations. Infection was documented in six patients (22%). Previous exposure to Chlamydia trachomatis was documented with 2 endocervical cultures and 17 serum specimens positive for IgG antibody. The culture results, however, did not correlate with the postoperative febrile morbidity. "
general pathological conditions,"Nausea, vomiting, and retching. Although nausea, vomiting, and retching have plagued mankind since antiquity, limited attention has been given to the three symptoms as separate entities. Although knowledge of symptom occurrence is essential to practice, nurses must focus on patients' response or distress to the occurrence of symptoms. The differentiation of symptom occurrence and symptom distress of nausea, vomiting, and retching is critical to the management and self-care demands of patients and the enhancement of their quality of life. Basic research on patterns of these individual symptoms and their components promises to provide a more progressive and fruitful approach to the patient response to these symptoms. "
general pathological conditions,"Reverse coitus: mechanism of urethral injury in male partner. Reverse coitus, a rarely used sexual position, makes the male urethra more vulnerable to injury from the pubic arch and symphysis pubis of the female partner. Severe pain, bleeding and immediate detumescence were observed in 3 patients. The lesion usually occurred at the fossa navicularis, responded well to conservative management and did not hinder micturition. Potency has been well preserved in all 3 patients. "
general pathological conditions,"Familial autosomal recessive rigid spine syndrome with neurogenic facio-scapulo-peroneal muscle atrophy. Two sisters and a first cousin presented with rigid spine and facio-scapulo-peroneal muscle atrophy. The patients belonged to a family with two first-cousin marriages. Electromyography, muscle and nerve biopsy showed neurogenic muscle atrophy without peripheral nerve involvement. Follow up did not show progression of the disease. This is the first observation of an association of neurogenic facio-scapulo-peroneal and rigid spine syndrome. The double first-cousin marriage suggests autosomal recessive inheritance. "
general pathological conditions,"Recurrent seizures in children with Shigella-associated convulsions. Fifty-five children with Shigella-associated convulsions were followed prospectively to investigate their risk of subsequent febrile or nonfebrile seizures. The duration of the follow-up period was between 6.9 and 14.1 years (9.7 +/- 3.1 years). No case of nonfebrile seizures and only 2 cases (3%) of subsequent febrile seizures were observed during this period. We conclude that although febrile and Shigella-associated convulsions share many clinical features, the natural history of these two conditions seems to be distinctly different. Shigella-related convulsions are not associated with an increased incidence of subsequent febrile or nonfebrile convulsions. "
general pathological conditions,"Alcohol-dependent unilateral vestibular impairment persisting after a closed head injury. A 20-year-old man suffered a closed head injury followed by symptoms of right-sided labyrinthine concussion with complete clinical recovery within 3 weeks. Episodic vertigo and ataxic gait occurred after the ingestion of small amounts of alcohol over the next 2 years. Electro-oculography revealed a right-sided peripheral type vestibular lesion, only after taking alcohol. This was interpreted as an alcohol-induced impairment of central compensation following an incomplete recovery from right-sided labyrinthine trauma. "
general pathological conditions,"Control of hypertensive emergencies Although uncommon, hypertensive emergencies require prompt recognition and treatment to reduce very high morbidity and mortality rates. Admission to an intensive care unit for treatment and monitoring is essential for optimal care. A Swan-Ganz catheter is often helpful in management. Intravenous nitroprusside sodium (Nipride, Nitropress) is probably the drug of choice for hypertensive emergencies other than those due to eclampsia or pheochromocytoma. "
general pathological conditions,"The value of preoperative estimation of haemoglobin in children undergoing tonsillectomy. Preoperative estimation of haemoglobin in children undergoing tonsillectomy is routinely practised in most centres. To assess the value of this investigation the haemoglobin of 250 consecutive children undergoing tonsillectomy was estimated. Two children were clinically found anaemic preoperatively, and this was confirmed on blood testing. Since the prevalence of anaemia is low, it is proposed that the practice of routine preoperative estimation of haemoglobin is unnecessary, traumatic and expensive, and therefore requires reconsideration. "
general pathological conditions,"Acetazolamide-responsive vestibulocerebellar syndrome: clinical and oculographic features. Five patients who presented with long-standing episodic vertigo had ocular motor signs localizing to the vestibulocerebellum. In each patient, the episodic vertigo was either abolished or markedly decreased in frequency and severity with acetazolamide therapy. In 4, other family members had identical symptoms and signs. This syndrome is 1 of the few treatable causes of chronic episodic vertigo. "
general pathological conditions,"Acute central nervous system symptoms caused by ibuprofen in connective tissue disease. We describe 2 cases of acute encephalopathy in patients with connective tissue disease caused by small doses of ibuprofen. In addition to aseptic meningitis, both patients had altered mental status and focal neurologic signs, ophthalmoplegia in one and hemiparesis in the other. The spectrum of neurologic manifestations of ibuprofen hypersensitivity is reviewed. "
general pathological conditions,"Bell's palsy. Ensuring the best possible outcome. Bell's palsy is thought to be an idiopathic polyneuritis and must be distinguished from other disorders that cause facial weakness. In most cases, differentiation can be accomplished on the basis of the history, physical examination, and clinical course. Routine follow-up care ensures that recovery is occurring. Electrodiagnostic testing often helps to assess prognosis. Eye care and corticosteroid therapy are recommended. "
general pathological conditions,"Hepatocyte transplantation into the lung for treatment of acute hepatic failure in the rat. The lung was investigated as a matrix for transplanted hepatocytes in the rat model. Surgically induced fulminant hepatic failure was successfully treated by injection of 5 to 7 x 10(7) isolated hepatocytes into the pulmonary parenchyma in 86% of the animals. No animal, however, survived injection of hepatocytes into the jugular vein. It was found that liver failure is a prerequisite for the intrapulmonary survival of hepatocytes. After regeneration of the native liver, the majority of hepatocytes are cleared away within 6 months. "
general pathological conditions,"Human atherosclerotic coronary artery xenografts: a model for investigation of transluminal recanalization. A model for testing transluminal recanalization techniques was developed. Fragments of human atherosclerotic coronary arteries were transplanted into carotid arteries of dogs and evaluated by angiographic, angioscopic, and histologic study within a three-month period. An inflammatory response was most intense within the first week. By two weeks no inflammation was noted. Total occlusion (n = 13) and stenosis (n = 11) of the carotid arteries were achieved without complications. The model is easy to produce within a short period and the arterial occlusion resembles human vascular disease. This model has been used to evaluate laser recanalization of vascular obstructions. "
general pathological conditions,"Conservative therapy for adnexal torsion. A case report. Adnexal torsion has traditionally been treated with oophorectomy because of the fear that untwisting the ovarian pedicle may result in a thrombotic embolus. Such a patient had bilateral adnexal torsion secondary to dermoid cysts. Since standard therapy, oophorectomy, was performed, the patient was surgically castrated. A review of the literature revealed no reported cases of a thrombotic embolus arising from the untwisting of twisted adnexa and supported conservation of the adnexa rather than routine extirpation, except when necrotic. "
general pathological conditions,"Acupuncture and chronic pain: a criteria-based meta-analysis. A literature search revealed 51 controlled clinical studies on the effectiveness of acupuncture in chronic pain. These studies were reviewed using a list of 18 predefined methodological criteria. A maximum of 100 points for study design could be earned in four main categories: (a) comparability of prognosis, (b) adequate intervention, (c) adequate effect measurement and (d) data presentation. The quality of even the better studies proved to be mediocre. No study earned more than 62% of the maximum score. The results from the better studies (greater than or equal to 50% of the maximum score) are highly contradictory. The efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic pain remains doubtful. "
general pathological conditions,"Spontaneous rupture of a normal bladder. We have reported a case of spontaneous rupture of a normal urinary bladder. Patients with this rare condition characteristically have a recent history of heavy alcohol intake, sudden onset of abdominal pain coincidental with bloody urine, generalized peritonitis, and abnormal renal chemistry. A high index of suspicion will lead to early diagnosis and treatment, minimizing the mortality attributed to this condition. "
general pathological conditions,"The electrocardiogram in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The electrocardiogram is often abnormal in patients who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The most frequent abnormalities are a rightward P-wave axis (greater than or equal to 70 degrees) and a rightward QRS axis (greater than or equal to 90 degrees). In addition, low voltage in the limb leads, an S1S2S3 pattern, poor R-wave progression, a posterior-superior terminal QRS vector or other changes may be present. Transient atrial and ventricular dysrhythmias are common. Knowledge of the usual electrocardiographic manifestations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease enables the clinician to recognize uncharacteristic abnormalities, which often represent the effects of superimposed illnesses or drug toxicity. "
general pathological conditions,"New insights into the causes of cancer. Recent advances in molecular biologic analysis have led to major new insights concerning the genetic mechanisms underlying the development of cancer. This article examines the current state of our understanding of the genetic basis underlying the possible mechanisms of carcinogenesis and metastasis. The nature of the genetic lesions found in some cancer-causing genes, cancer-inhibiting genes, growth factor genes, and metastasis genes is discussed, as is the impact that these may have on clinical oncology. "
general pathological conditions,Deep vein obstruction and leg swelling caused by femoral ganglion. We present a case of a rare ganglion cyst originating from the hip joint and compressing the common femoral vein producing signs and symptoms that mimicked a deep vein thrombosis. Excision of the mass promptly restored normal venous return. This condition has not been previously reported in the English-language medical literature. 
general pathological conditions,"Severe tricuspid regurgitation after mitral valve repair: diagnosis by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography. Transesophageal echocardiography facilitates the evaluation of valvular repair in the operating room. The functional valvular morphology and degree of valvular regurgitation can be assessed before and after repair. This technique can also identify unsuspected findings--in this case, severe tricuspid regurgitation complicating cardiopulmonary bypass. We report a previously undescribed cause of traumatic tricuspid regurgitation. "
general pathological conditions,"The detubularized right colonic segment as urinary reservoir: evolution of technique for continent diversion. Continent diversion of urine via a cecal-right colonic reservoir has been performed at our university hospital since 1977. Several modifications of surgical technique have been devised to prevent problems of urinary leakage and difficulties in catheterization. The current technique, used during the last 3 years on 14 patients, involves use of a detubularized right colonic segment as a reservoir, ileal mesenteric exclusion, fashioning the intussuscepted ileal nipple valve with staples and anchoring of a fascia strip sling around the nipple base to the anterior rectus sheath. Complication from the reservoir outlet occurred in only 1 patient. "
neoplasms,"Primary prevention of cancer. The case for comprehensive school health education. Comprehensive school health education plays an important role in the primary prevention of cancer because so many of the health habits relating to cancer and other diseases have their onset early in life. A comprehensive health education program should begin early in life. Such education must be multifactorial from kindergarten through high school, should involve annual health screening, must be assessed annually, and is most effective when coordinated by a full-time health education teacher. Those concerned about the many problems of health behavior in our society should insist that such programs become mandatory in every state in this nation. "
neoplasms,"Molecular phenotype of a pediatric small round cell tumor. Molecular probes were used to characterize an unusual small round cell abdominal tumor arising from the fallopian tube of a 15-year-old girl. DNA and RNA extracted from the tumor and adjacent normal tissue was subjected to Southern and Northern blot analysis using a variety of different probes. N-myc oncogene RNA was greatly expressed in the tumor, but was not expressed in normal tissue or amplified in chromosomal DNA. Insulin-like growth factor II RNA was similarly overexpressed in the neoplasm, but not in normal tissue. While histopathologic studies could not distinguish between a neuroectodermal neoplasm and Wilms' tumor, electron microscopy and the pattern of gene expression was most consistent with Wilms' tumor. "
neoplasms,"Giant cell tumor of bone. Giant cell tumor is the second most common benign tumor of bone. Plain radiographs may demonstrate distinctive features but can also be misleading. The diagnosis may be aided by the use of other imaging modalities, such as bone scan, computed tomography and angiography. The recurrence rate is high, but some of the newer treatments seem to be associated with better outcomes. "
neoplasms,Extraoral application of osseointegrated implants. The use of osseointegrated implants to provide support for craniofacial prostheses has provided the clinician with another approach to the treatment of complex craniofacial reconstructive problems. The surgical technique is reviewed and the Mayo Clinic experience is presented. 
neoplasms,"Alternating cisplatinum and VAC ineffective in end stage squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Sixteen patients with end stage squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were admitted to a phase II study of alternating courses of cisplatinum (100 mg/m2) and VAC (vincristine 1.4 mg/m2, adriamycin 50 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2) given at three weekly intervals. Only two patients achieved a response (12 per cent). The median survival time was 62 days which is much the same as that of a similar group of patients who received no chemotherapy in a previous trial (70 days). "
neoplasms,"Epidermodysplasia verruciformis-associated papillomavirus infection complicating human immunodeficiency virus disease. Three males infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were noted to have extensive flat warts of the face and/or body. In two there were also pityriasis versicolor-like lesions. Biopsies showed foamy, basophilic, distended cytoplasm in granular layer keratinocytes, characteristic of the human papillomavirus types seen in epidermodysplasia verruciformis. DNA hybridization techniques demonstrated the presence of HPV-type 8 in one patient and HPV 5 and 8 in another. Patients with immune suppression due to HIV infection may demonstrate the clinical features of epidermodysplasia verruciformis with the same potentially oncogenic HPV types. "
neoplasms,"Childhood blindness in Peru. A survey of childhood blindness in Peruvian children was done. Although most causes of blindness were due to congenital and hereditary conditions, measles accounted for almost 10% of blindness. With widespread measles immunization, this preventable cause of blindness in children can be eliminated or dramatically reduced. "
neoplasms,"Jejunal-rectal fistula as a complication of postoperative radiotherapy. We present the case of a patient with an unusual, complex enteric fistula with multiple tracts and associated abscesses. The fistula was a late complication of radiotherapy, administered three years earlier, after resection for carcinoma of the sigmoid colon. Most of the small bowel was involved in the radiation-induced disease. A wide resection was performed successfully. This report reviews current literature on intra-abdominal postradiotherapy injuries, particularly intestinal fistulae. "
neoplasms,"Angiotropic B-cell lymphoma (malignant angioendotheliomatosis): failure of systemic chemotherapy. A 65-year-old female with angiotropic B-cell lymphoma is reported. Despite the absence of systemic involvement on formal staging and the favourable response of the cutaneous lesions to triple systemic chemotherapy with prednisolone, vincristine and cyclophosphamide, postmortem findings showed that death was due to widespread disease dissemination. "
neoplasms,A case of amnesia after excision of the septum pellucidum. Tumours of the septum pellucidum (SP) are rare and seldom associated with memory impairment either before or after operation. A patient is described who developed amnesia after transcallosal excision of a tumour of the SP. Radiology did not show any major lesion of the brain areas traditionally associated with amnesia. Because septal nuclei could have been damaged during surgery their possible role in memory functions is discussed. 
neoplasms,"Chondrosarcoma of the soft tissues. Two different sub-groups. Chondrosarcomas arising from soft tissues are rare. Two different varieties are described, myxoid and mesenchymal. We have collected nine cases of the tumour, five myxoid and four mesenchymal, from a review of 513 cases of chondrosarcoma seen between 1904 and 1988. We report the principal clinical, radiographical and histological differences between the two varieties and discuss their surgical treatment and prognosis. "
neoplasms,"Pinch modification used to repair a large surgical defect on the scalp: other proposed uses. Dr Peng's ""pinch modification"" of the linear advancement flap, a reconstructive technique used to correct surgical wounds on the nose and suggested as a surgical alternative in other non-hair-bearing skin, was used successfully to correct a surgical defect of 55 mm in diameter located on the occipital area, on hair-bearing skin. Other possible uses for this technique are suggested. "
neoplasms,"Microdochectomy for discharge from a single lactiferous duct. Microdochectomy for persistent discharge from a single lactiferous duct was performed in 162 women. Invasive or in situ ductal carcinoma was diagnosed in 16 patients (10 per cent), none of whom had a palpable lump. The discharge was blood-stained in 14 of these women and in two it was clear. Mammography was performed in 15 of these 16 patients and was abnormal in only five. Three patients had atypical ductal hyperplasia, one of whom subsequently developed an invasive ductal carcinoma. Microdochectomy for persistent discharge from a single lactiferous duct is curative and gives a diagnosis of the cause. It remains the treatment of choice whether the discharge is blood-stained or clear. "
neoplasms,Angiosarcoma of the uterus: a case report. We are reporting a case of angiosarcoma of the uterus in which the diagnosis was confirmed ultrastructurally by demonstration of Weibel-Palade bodies in the tumor cells. Only 10 cases of this entity have been previously documented in the literature. 
neoplasms,"Continuous muscle fiber activity, peripheral neuropathy, and thymoma. Two patients, one of them with myasthenia gravis, presented symptoms of continuous muscle fiber activity syndrome before discovery of a thymoma. Peripheral neuropathy was present in both patients, with axonal and demyelinating lesions in sural nerve biopsy. The syndrome remained unchanged or worse after thymectomy. Both patients died of associated complications. "
neoplasms,"Ganglioneuroma of the spinal cord. This report describes a 2-year-old boy who harbored an intramedullary ganglioneuroma involving almost the entire length of the spinal cord. The terminology, pathology, and neurobiological behavior of this tumor is discussed. "
neoplasms,"Leiomyoma of a digital artery. Benign, soft-tissue masses of the hand are common. A vascular leiomyoma is an unusual tumor of smooth-muscle origin. In a 62-year-old man, the tumor arose from within a digital artery. Persistent symptoms prompted an excisional biopsy, requiring resection of a portion of the artery. Adequate collateral circulation preempted the need for a vascular graft. Vascular repair or grafting may be necessary if collateral circulation is not adequate. "
neoplasms,"Nonendoscopic percutaneous gastrostomy. Tight peritoneal adherence of the stomach to the abdominal wall as a prerequisite of percutaneous gastrostomy can be achieved by a newly developed cannula. It serves for puncture and fixation of the gastric wall. Thus, percutaneous gastrostomy can be established safely even in instances of an endoscopically nonaccessible stomach. Further applications of the device for the purpose of intestinopexy and facilitation of endoscopic procedures are being evaluated. "
neoplasms,"Tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesions of the head and neck. The term 'tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion' has been used to describe a fibrosclerosing disorder which has a locally destructive nature but is characterized by a benign histological appearance. We report five patients, over a five year period, with such a lesion. The clinical behaviour and surgical findings suggest the lesion to be an invasive malignancy. However, the histological appearance of an admixture of chronic inflammatory cells and fibrosis is consistent with a benign condition. We recommend surgical excision of the lesion as the mainstay of treatment; other studies report the use of steroids and radiotherapy. "
neoplasms,"Principles of treatment of pediatric solid tumors. Great strides have been made in the treatment of pediatric solid tumors over the last three decades. A multimodality approach involving a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy is now used in the treatment of these diseases. This article reviews the principles that guide the use of these modalities and the multidisciplinary approach used to integrate them into a coordinated treatment plan. The role of each modality in the control of local and systemic disease is described. Radiation treatment planning, dose fractionation, and toxicity are also discussed. "
neoplasms,"Management of symptomatic lymphocele via percutaneous drainage and sclerotherapy with tetracycline. Lymph collections following pelvic surgery are usually asymptomatic, but may occasionally produce symptoms requiring invasive therapy. We have successfully obliterated a large lymphocele by employing percutaneous drainage and instilling tetracycline. "
neoplasms,"Central neurogenic hyperventilation in invasive laryngeal carcinoma. We describe a patient with central neurogenic hyperventilation secondary to extension of a laryngeal tumor into the base of the brain, resulting in extrinsic compression of the medulla. Such an association has not been previously described. Unique features which distinguish this patient from previously reported cases are emphasized. Possible mechanisms involved in pathogenesis, as well as types of therapy, are outlined. "
neoplasms,"Cells immunoreactive for neuropeptide in human thymomas. The presence of opioid peptides, bombesin, and substance P was investigated by immunohistochemistry in tissue sections from six human thymomas. The number of immunoreactive cells seemed to vary from one case to another. Ultrastructural investigation, showing the presence of desmosomes in labelled cells, allowed these cells to be classified as epithelial lineage cells. The occurrence of cells containing neuropeptide in thymomas suggest that peptide molecules could have modulated the behaviour of this tumour, given the reported influence of these molecules on immune functions and their growth promoting activity on several cell types, including mesenchymal and epithelial cells. "
neoplasms,"Recombinant IFN-alpha in lymphomas. The effectiveness of interferon (IFN) therapy in malignant lymphoma is analyzed in this review. Although various treatment regimens including IFN at various dose levels have so far not proved to have curative potential, a substantial palliative effect has been noted in hairy-cell leukemia and in some non-Hodgkin lymphomas of low-grade malignancy. Early stages of lymphoma disease are more responsive to IFN therapy, and this holds true also for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, in which IFN treatment is usually not effective in progressed disease after chemotherapy. Concepts of early-phase treatment and of remission maintenance by using IFN therapy are discussed on the basis of the data from several studies. "
neoplasms,"Widespread inflammatory response to osteoblastoma: the flare phenomenon. A case of vertebral osteoblastoma caused a diffuse, reactive inflammatory infiltrate in two vertebrae, adjacent ribs, and the paraspinous soft tissues. The authors call this the flare phenomenon. On magnetic resonance images the diffuse inflammatory response caused a misleading appearance that simulated a malignant process (lymphoma or Ewing sarcoma). A computed tomographic myelogram was diagnostic. "
neoplasms,"Pigmented spindle cell naevus. We report 22 cases of pigmented spindle cell naevus (PSCN). The usual appearance of these naevi is that of a heavily pigmented papule found mostly on the legs of young patients. Histologically, PSCN was characterized by symmetrical proliferation of spindle-shaped pigmented melanocytes grouped in large junctional nests. Pagetoid spread of single cells in the overlying epidermis was frequently found. In our opinion, PSCN is a distinctive benign acquired melanocytic naevus that in the past has been frequently misdiagnosed as atypical Spitz naevi or malignant melanoma. "
neoplasms,"Dilatation in the duplex kidney: 3 unusual cases. Dilatation in the upper limb of a duplex ureter is usually secondary to obstruction and may be associated with a ureterocele. By contrast, vesicoureteric reflux is the usual cause of a dilated lower moiety ureter. We report 3 cases in which unusual or complex causes of dilatation of 1 limb of a duplex ureter were demonstrated. "
neoplasms,"Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the ampulla of vater. A case of absence of somatostatin in a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-, bombesin-, and cholecystokinin-producing tumor. A 31-year-old patient with a clinical picture of obstructive jaundice had surgical treatment, and a primary carcinoid of the ampulla of Vater (VA) was found. The tumor was studied with light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. The neoplasm had histopathologic and cytopathologic features similar to those encountered in typical neuroendocrine neoplasms. It is interesting that immunohistochemical techniques disclosed the presence of vasointestinal polypeptide, cholecystokinin, and bombesin; however, unlike most neuroendocrine neoplasms arising in VA, no somatostatin-immunoreactive cells were found. "
neoplasms,"Histopathologic study of otitis media in individuals with head and neck tumors. Five temporal bones, each including the eustachian tube, were obtained from five adults with advanced malignant tumors of the head and neck. The specimens were from the side on which the tumor had occurred. Otitis media had been detected clinically in two cases, and was detected histopathologically in the other three. We discuss the possibility that otitis media might have been caused by tumor invasion of the paratubal area, by postoperative inflammation in the nasopharynx, or by an inflammatory reaction of tubal structures to radiotherapy, or that these conditions may have coexisted. "
neoplasms,"Emergent signs of cancer. Recognizing them early in the office or ER. Primary care physicians have a crucial role in recognition of potentially emergent conditions in patients with known or suspected cancer. This task presents a significant challenge because the initial manifestations of these conditions are usually nonspecific. In most cases, therapy is far more effective when diagnosis is made at the earliest possible point. Thus, physicians should become familiar with conditions commonly seen in cancer patients, such as superior vena cava syndrome, malignant pericardial effusion, spinal-epidural metastasis, and altered mentation from brain metastases, metabolic encephalopathy, or hypoglycemia. "
neoplasms,"Hoarseness as the sole presenting symptom of foramen magnum meningioma. Foramen magnum tumours are rare. They may present with bizarre symptoms and mimic many conditions. We report a presentation with the sole complaint of hoarseness, never previously described in the literature. Voice returned to normal after surgical removal of the foramen magnum meningioma. "
neoplasms,Pulmonary disease following intravesical BCG treatment. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis that has been used in the treatment of malignant disease for over 20 years and for the treatment of bladder cancer since 1976. Major complications of this treatment are infrequent. We report two cases of systemic illness with pulmonary manifestations after treatment with intravesical BCG. 
neoplasms,Bilateral renal cell carcinoma with metastasis to thyroid. A case of bilateral synchronous renal cell carcinomas with metastases to the regional lymph nodes and later to the thyroid gland was treated with aggressive surgical extirpation and adjuvant gamma interferon. The patient continues to have an excellent performance status sixteen months after initial diagnosis despite a large tumor burden at presentation. 
neoplasms,Clinical significance of colonic fermentation. Recent evidence of the potential benefits of short chain fatty acids has prompted renewed interest in the area of human colonic fermentation. This paper reviews the clinical and metabolic consequences of colonic fermentation. 
neoplasms,"Human papillomavirus in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Thirty seven cases of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma were studied by applying DNA slot blot analysis and in situ hybridisation using type specific probes for HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18. Cases of condyloma accuminata, cervical carcinoma, and laryngeal papilloma were used as controls. Blocks including areas of invasive carcinoma, intraepithelial neoplasia, and normal epithelium were studied in each case. No HPV genome was detectable in any of the oesophageal cases. It is concluded that these types of HPV do not have an association with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. "
neoplasms,"Ileal duplication cyst causing massive bleeding in a child. Intestinal duplication is a rare congenital anomaly; nonetheless, it comprises more than half of all alimentary duplication disorders. Our case report describes the hemorrhagic sequelae of this entity with surgical and pathologic findings. A review of anatomical classification, embryology, and natural history of duplication cyst follows; differentiating characteristics of duplication cyst versus Meckel's diverticulum are outlined. Intestinal duplication cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of GI bleeding, especially in children. "
neoplasms,Colon cancer in pregnancy with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level at presentation. A case of colon cancer in pregnancy is presented in which the maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level was elevated. Failure to evaluate colon cancer as a cause of the elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein may have accounted for the poor outcome. 
neoplasms,"Malignant fibrous histiocytoma developing in bone 44 years after shrapnel trauma. Tumors induced by foreign bodies are uncommon in humans, but they are a relatively common occurrence in some experimental animals. The development of sarcoma in association with metallic foreign bodies has rarely been reported. The development of a malignant fibrous histiocytoma in a 65-year-old man 44 years after shrapnel fragments lodged in his left arm is described. The literature regarding metallic foreign body-induced cancer in humans is reviewed. "
neoplasms,Squamous carcinoma metastatic to the sternum. A 63-year-old man had a 10 x 16-cm sternal mass 18 months after a second aortocoronary bypass operation. The resected lesion was a metastatic tumor of squamous histology. No primary tumor was found. The diagnostic work-up and treatment options are presented. 
neoplasms,"Acute myeloid leukemia and background radiation in an expanded case-referent study. A case-referent study that investigated possible associations between environmental and occupational exposures and acute myeloid leukemia was performed on 86 cases and 172 referents, all of whom were living. Exposure information was obtained through a questionnaire mailed to each subject. An association was found between time spent in concrete buildings at home and work and leukemia morbidity. In addition, extensive x-ray examinations that occurred more than 5 y prior to diagnosis were more common among cases than referents. "
neoplasms,Second primary tumours of the larynx following bronchial carcinoma. The occurrence of multiple primary malignancies in patients with laryngeal cancer is well known. The possibility that lung cancer patients may be at risk of subsequent laryngeal cancer is less well recognized. The possibility of laryngeal cancer developing later has implications for the follow-up of lung cancer patients. Three cases of subsequent laryngeal primary cancer occurring in survivors of bronchial cancer are presented and the implications are discussed. 
neoplasms,"Sarcoid reaction mimicking intrathoracic dissemination of testicular cancer. The close observation of patients treated for testicular cancer led to the suspicion of intrathoracic and/or mediastinal metastases on radiologic examination in a number of patients without other evidence of relapse. This report presents two patients with combined seminomatous and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors with isolated sarcoid reactions of hilar and interlobular lymph nodes, detected concomitant with diagnosis and 12 months after diagnosis, respectively. Histologic examination appears to be imperative in these cases to avoid unnecessary chemotherapy. "
neoplasms,"Glomus tumours of the skin: an immunohistochemical investigation of the expression of marker proteins. Immunohistochemical studies were carried out on cutaneous glomus tumours from 10 patients. The glomus areas in these tumours reacted strongly with anti-smooth muscle (CGA-7), anti-muscle (HHF-35) and anti-vimentin antibodies. Their neural supply was analysed using several nervous tissue markers (anti-neurone specific enolase, anti-S 100, anti-Leu 7, anti-neurofilaments). The results indicate a sprouting and proliferation rather than entrapment of pre-existing nerve fibres. "
neoplasms,"The melanocyte and melanoma. This paper reviewed some of the interesting biological aspects of melanocytes and their relationship to the nevus and to melanoma. It also proposed a rationale for ""adequate"" surgery in the management of melanoma according to level, depth, margins, and trends in treatment. These propositions were derived from an analysis of 995 cases of melanoma of the head and neck. "
neoplasms,"Lung lobe torsion following lobectomy. Three cases of postoperative pulmonary lobe torsion were reported. Two of three showed hemorrhagic infarctions, and as a result underwent rethoracotomies and removal of the affected lobes. From these experiences, we consider that computed tomography (CT) and bronchofiberscopic examinations are useful for the diagnosis of advanced torsion. "
neoplasms,"Mucinous cystadenoma of the lung. A report of two cases with immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analysis. We describe two patients who presented with solitary pulmonary masses that consisted of unilocular cysts lined by columnar mucinous epithelium. The cysts contained copious mucus. The epithelial lining of the cysts showed foci of stratification and papillary infolding. Histologically identical lesions have previously been termed unusual mucous cysts or mucinous cystadenomas. We believe that these tumors are true neoplasms differentiating toward the respiratory epithelial mucous cell. They should be distinguished from a variety of pulmonary neoplasms including bronchoalveolar carcinoma, bronchial mucous gland adenoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and metastatic adenocarcinoma. "
neoplasms,"Psychoneuroimmunology. Implications for oncology? Accumulating evidence indicates that the central nervous system (CNS) may regulate the activity of the immune system. Although the overall significance of the immune system in cancer remains controversial, psychosocial influences on immune function could potentially provide a mechanism to account for some of the reports of an association between psychosocial factors and cancer prognosis. "
neoplasms,Spitz nevi in black children. Four black children with Spitz nevi are presented. The initial clinical diagnosis was pyogenic granuloma for three patients. One child had two Spitz nevi. Histologic examination revealed melanocytic dendritic hyperplasia in all cases. 
neoplasms,"Rectus abdominis muscle flap with microvascular anastomoses for repair of recurrent sarcoma. After radical resection of a recurrent leiomyosarcoma, the thoracic wall was stabilized with a Gore-Tex graft. The skin and soft tissue defect was repaired with a large rectus abdominis flap in which the circulation was secured by end-to-end microvascular anastomosis of the inferior epigastric artery to the internal mammary artery, which had to be cut during tumor removal. "
neoplasms,"Cryoprobe as a ""handle"" for resection of metastatic liver tumors. Resection of metastatic liver tumors can be a difficult and risky procedure. Using a cryoprobe as a ""handle"" can greatly facilitate resection by providing a taut surface for transection and improving visualization of ductal and vascular structures. In addition, this technique may decrease the risk of contaminating surrounding tissues with cancer cells, and may inhibit tumor recurrence within the margins of resection. "
neoplasms,Pathologic fracture through a solitary enchondroma of the radial diaphysis: case report. Solitary enchondromata are rare but well recognised benign bone tumours. They are extremely rare in the radius. We report the case of a pathologic fracture through a solitary enchondroma in the radial diaphysis and its successful treatment. 
neoplasms,"Imaging of pharyngeal and laryngeal carcinomas with indium-111-labeled monoclonal anti-CEA antibodies. Localization of primary tumors, metastases, or recurrences in 13 consecutive patients with histological verification of squamous cell or adenocarcinoma was made with radioimmunodetection using monoclonal radiolabeled anti-CEA antibody. All surgical specimens stained immunohistochemically, except one, were positive for CEA. Of the known 19 tumor sites 17 were visualized in antibody scans. There were two positive findings that did not prove to be positive during 12 month follow-up. The scintigram findings did not correlate with CEA serum concentrations that, with one exception, were normal in all patients. "
neoplasms,"Preoperative endoscopic diagnosis of fibroepithelial polyp of the renal pelvis: a case report and review of the literature. Benign fibroepithelial polyps of the renal pelvis are rare, with only 9 cases described previously in the literature. We report an additional case and suggest how nephrectomy may be avoided. "
neoplasms,Introduction to limb-salvage surgery for sarcomas. This article provides a history of limb-salvage surgery and definitions of terms used to describe aspects of the procedure. Staging is also discussed. 
neoplasms,"An electron and optical microscopic study of juxtaposed odontogenic keratocyst and carcinoma. Odontogenic keratocyst and squamous cell carcinoma commonly occur within the oral cavity; however, the juxtaposition of these lesions is rare. The light microscopic and ultrastructural features of such an event are reported. Although some morphologic similarities between the cyst and tumor were observed, definitive evidence of a common origin was not obtained. "
neoplasms,"Kaposi's sarcoma involvement of the bone marrow. Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a predominantly cutaneous malignancy with several clinical variants. Extracutaneous sites of involvement are uncommon in all disease variants except epidemic KS (human immunodeficiency virus related) and the African lymphadenopathic variant. Extracutaneous KS usually involves the lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory tract. The authors report the first description of a patient with classic KS to have bone marrow involvement. Two additional patients with KS variants and bone marrow involvement have been described. Bone marrow tumor invasion should be considered in patients with KS and hematologic abnormalities. "
neoplasms,"Rhabdomyosarcoma. From the laboratory to the clinic. The prospect of identifying and developing new agents for treatment of rhabdomyosarcomas is discussed in the light of current prognosis for children with advanced stage disease. Preliminary attempts to identify tumor-specific agents using in vitro cell culture show potential promise, but as yet remain unproven. The more complex system of identifying therapeutically active agents using human tumor xenografts has demonstrated usefulness. The potential problems associated with this system are discussed. "
neoplasms,"Skin ultrasound in dermatologic surgical planning. High-resolution ultrasonography was performed on 55 patients with palpable skin lesions, all submitted to surgical excision and to histologic diagnosis. In all the cases, the ultrasound picture was confirmed by the surgical appearance of the lesions. The sonographic structure was characteristic in the case of cysts and angiomas, lymphangiomas in particular. Ultrasonography is considered a simple and reliable technique for the pre-operative evaluation of skin nodules, as it gives a clear picture of their size, depth, and outline. However, sonography cannot substitute for the clinical dermatologic approach and the need for an histologic diagnosis. "
neoplasms,"Role of ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. In 170 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, ultrasound showed a high sensitivity in identifying focal liver lesions. Fine needle aspiration biopsy guided by ultrasound yielded a pathological diagnosis in the majority of cases. The advantages of this technique, its high diagnostic yield and low cost, render the older technique of blind percutaneous biopsy using a coarse needle obsolete. Laparoscopy retains its essential role in selected cases. Complementary use of fine needle aspiration biopsy under ultrasound guidance and laparoscopy assures the highest rate of diagnostic accuracy in hepatocellular carcinoma. We confirm the poor sensitivity of alpha fetoprotein. "
neoplasms,"Multicentric cloacogenic carcinoma: report of a case with anogenital pruritus at presentation. A case of multicentric cloacogenic carcinoma of the perianal skin and vulva in a 79-year-old woman is presented, and the embryologic basis for the multicentricity is discussed. Histologically, cloacogenic carcinoma can be differentiated from other small cell neoplasms that affect the area. Cloacogenic carcinoma should be considered a rare cause of anogenital pruritus. It is important to perform an early biopsy of anogenital lesions that do not respond to conventional therapy. "
neoplasms,"Scalp pilomatrix carcinoma as an extra-axial mass. We report the CT, MRI, and angiographic findings in a case of pilomatrix carcinoma that had invaded the temporal bone and presented itself as an extra-axial mass. Even though bone destruction was better shown with CT, the tumor mass with its meningeal and tentorial extension was seen more clearly with MRI. The arteriogram demonstrated a unique vascular supply from the external carotid artery. "
neoplasms,"Vasculitis as a paraneoplastic syndrome. Report of 11 cases and review of the literature. In a study of 222 patients with vasculitis, we identified 11 who had an associated neoplasia. Seven had hematological neoplasia and 4 had solid malignant tumors. In 4 patients vasculitis gave the first evidence of the neoplasia or of its recurrence. Nine of our patients had cutaneous vasculitis. The other 2 had vasculitis involving the intestine and resulted in acute abdomens. These 2 patients needed prednisone treatment for the vasculitis. Neoplasia should be considered in patients with vasculitis without an apparent cause. "
neoplasms,"Hyperfunctioning metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma in Pendred's syndrome. A 66-year-old woman with Pendred's syndrome underwent a partial thyroidectomy when she was 17 years old. At the age of 52 years, she had a second thyroid operation because of hyperthyroidism due to a toxic multinodular goiter with a mediastinal extension consisting of several separate nodules. Five years later a hyperfunctioning metastatic follicular carcinoma was diagnosed histologically. After treatment with radioactive iodine, the patient was well. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first description of a metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma in Pendred's syndrome and the first report of hyperthyroidism occurring after malignant degeneration of a dyshormonogenetic goiter. "
neoplasms,"Epidermoid tumors of the 4th ventricle: report of seven cases. Epidermoid tumors occur very rarely in the 4th ventricle. We discuss the history, clinical course, and the surgical results for seven patients. One patient had a remittal of symptoms, probably due to the emergence of the tumor from the 4th ventricle into the cisterna magna. Total removal of the capsule was possible only in the youngest patient. At present, four patients (mean follow-up, 6 years) enjoy good general and neurological health. "
neoplasms,"Paraneoplastic vasculitic neuropathy: a treatable neuropathy. Paraneoplastic vasculitic neuropathy has been recently described. We report the first case of this disorder which responded both clinically and electrophysiologically to cyclophosphamide treatment. A 54-year-old woman with a history of metastatic endometrial carcinoma in remission had asymmetrical polyneuropathy, electrophysiological findings consistent with a diffuse axonal neuropathy, high sedimentation rate and spinal fluid protein, and microvasculitis with axonal degeneration on nerve biopsy. The patient was treated with 150 mg of cyclophosphamide daily with gradual clinical and electrophysiological improvement. "
neoplasms,"Squamous cell carcinoma of prostate. A primary squamous cell carcinoma occurring in the prostate of a sixty-nine-year-old man is described. A radical excision that included cystoprostatectomy, total penectomy, scrotectomy, pubic symphysiectomy, and abdominoperineal resection of rectum was done. The patient died of systemic metastases six months after diagnosis. Review of the literature suggests that such a cancer of the prostate is rare, highly aggressive, and responds poorly to any mode of therapy. Histogenesis of this tumor remains controversial; however, it probably does not originate from the prostatic acinar cells. "
neoplasms,Selective catheterization of the inferior petrosal sinuses: new catheter design. Catheters for selective catheterization of the right and left inferior petrosal sinuses have been developed to replace the complex tip-deflector catheter-guide-wire system currently used. The new catheters are easily formed from commonly available straight catheters with the use of steam. They have been successfully tested in 22 patients; the only complications were minor groin hematomas. 
neoplasms,"Extradural implantation of sacral anterior root stimulators. A technique for extradural deafferentation of the S2 to S5 segments and extradural implantation of stimulating electrodes is described, and its application to twelve patients with spinal cord lesions is reported. Nine patients use their implants for micturition, and seven are fully continent. The advantages and disadvantages of this technique compared with the more usual intrathecal procedure are discussed. "
neoplasms,"Optic nerve gliomas and meningiomas. Optic nerve gliomas are benign astrocytic neoplasms that primarily affect children. The ultimate prognosis for vision is poor. For lesions confined to the optic nerves, long-term survival is excellent, but with involvement of the chiasm and especially of the hypothalamus or third ventricle, prognosis falls significantly. For this group, no form of therapy has proven to be of any benefit. Optic sheath meningiomas are neoplasms arising from arachnoid cap cells. They primarily affect middle-aged adults. Like gliomas, the prognosis for vision is poor, but unlike gliomas, prognosis for life is excellent. "
neoplasms,"Intrahepatic lymphatics opacified during hepatic arteriography in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma. Extrahepatic lymph node metastases are not uncommon in advanced cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This is the account of a HCC case in which intrahepatic lymphatics running toward the hepatic hilus were clearly opacified during hepatic arteriography. The patient was treated by hepatic artery embolization followed by selective embolization of the portal branches, but lymph node metastases at the hepatic hilus were later found during follow-up. The clinical course of this case suggests that the communication between the tumor and the lymphatics was responsible for the lymph node metastasis. "
neoplasms,Patterns of epidermal growth factor receptors in basal and squamous cell carcinoma. The presence of immunoreactive epidermal growth factor receptors in human skin tumors was investigated using the indirect immunoperoxidase technique. Sixteen basal cell carcinomas and 11 squamous cell carcinomas were evaluated. All of the specimens studied were receptor positive. In 70% of the specimens there was prominent staining of the cell membranes. In 54% of the nodular basal cell carcinoma specimens there was increased staining at the periphery of the tumor cell masses. 
neoplasms,"Liposarcoma arising in the cheek: report of a case and review of the literature. The following points can be made about liposarcoma of the oral cavity: 1) it is rare and slow growing; 2) it is often mistaken for a benign lesion; 3) there is a direct correlation of microscopic appearance with biological behavior and prognosis; 4) treatment is primarily surgical, with radiation used for selected cases; and 5) the better-differentiated tumors seem to respond more favorably to radiation. "
neoplasms,"Enterogenous cyst of the cerebellopontine angle cistern: case report. A case of an enterogenous cyst located in the cerebellopontine angle cistern is presented. These cysts have usually been found in the spinal canal, and their intracranial occurrence is exceptional. In the present case, the cyst was lined histologically by a single epithelial layer of cuboidal cells with some glandular structures resembling the fundic glands of the stomach. The unusual location of the cyst and its histological features are discussed. "
neoplasms,Multiple primary malignancies in patients with malignant tumours of the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses. The incidence of multiple primary malignancies (MPM) was analysed in 1297 patients with malignant tumours of the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses. The patients were followed for a minimum of six years or until death. The incidence of MPM was 3.4 per cent (44/1297) which is lower in patients with malignant tumours of other regions in the upper aerodigestive tract. Five of the 44 patients had second malignancies within previously irradiated areas. There was a difference between the proportion of histologies occurring in irradiated tissues compared with the overall 1297 patients. This finding suggests that radiotherapy may induce a second cancer. 
neoplasms,"Pulmonary malignant angioendotheliomatosis. Presentation with fever and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. A 64-year-old man presented with protracted fever, hyponatremia, and mononeuritis multiplex. Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion was established. The absence of pulmonary infiltrates precluded any lung biopsy. Autopsy revealed malignant angioendotheliomatosis involving multiple organs including the alveolar septa and pulmonary vasculature. An early diagnosis of MAE in the setting of fever and SIADH may be possible via transbronchial biopsy. "
neoplasms,Colonic lipoma as a source of massive hemorrhage. Report of a case. Colonic lipomas are a rare source of massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding requiring operative intervention. A case of massive hemorrhage from cecal lipomatosis is presented. The methods of preoperative diagnosis and treatment are discussed. 
neoplasms,Postoperative ectopic craniopharyngioma. Case report. The case of an ectopic craniopharyngioma arising from a seed of tissue deposited along the operative track is reported. The uniqueness of this lesion is addressed. Ideal therapy and controversies regarding radiation therapy of craniopharyngiomas are discussed in light of this new variation in recurrence. 
neoplasms,"Occurrence of beta-hexachlorocyclohexane in breast cancer patients. The residues of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and neutral organochlorine compounds in breast fat of 44 breast cancer patients and 33 women free of cancer were determined. No statistically significant differences appeared between the two comparison groups with regard to occurrence of PAH compounds. Of the neutral organochlorine compounds, residues of beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) were found more frequently in breast cancer patients. After adjusting for age and parity by stepwise logistic regression, beta-HCH remained a significant risk factor of breast cancer. Using a cutoff point for the residue level of beta-HCH in breast adipose tissue of more than 0.1 mg/kg fat, the odds ratio was 10.51 (95% CI, 2.00-55.26). "
neoplasms,Epidermotropic eccrine porocarcinoma. Three cases of epidermotropic eccrine porocarcinoma are summarized and compared with reported cases. All patients had a long-standing tumor on a lower extremity that rapidly metastasized to the skin and proximal lymph nodes. The histologic picture was consistent with an intraepidermal eccrine sweat gland carcinoma. 
neoplasms,"Vascular lesions of the intestines. This article reviews the pathology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of vascular lesions of the intestine as a cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. In addition, a modified system for classifying such lesions, based on the author's personal experience with such lesions, is presented. "
neoplasms,"Intraosseous lipomatosis. A case report. We report a case of systemic intraosseous lipomatosis involving the proximal femur, both ends of the tibia, and the tarsal and metatarsal bones. The lesions progressed during a five-year follow-up with a pathological fracture of the tibial plateau. CT scans were characteristic and helpful in diagnosis but MR imaging added little information. Intraosseous lipomatosis is a hamartomatous malformation due to hyperplasia of adipose tissue, and is fundamentally different from solitary benign intraosseous lipoma. Management involves reconstruction of any pathological fracture. Large progressive lesions should be treated by curettage and grafting in an attempt to prevent such fractures. "
neoplasms,"Diagnosis of metastatic lesions to the stomach by salvage cytology. A report of three cases. Secondary neoplasms of the stomach are rare and are often clinical and diagnostic problems. Three patients with bleeding ""volcano-like"" ulcers were diagnosed by combined endoscopic ""salvage"" cytology and surgical biopsy as having metastatic submucosal lesions from hematologic spread. The combination of endoscopic appearance, clinical findings, and tissue and cytologic examination can lead to the correct diagnosis. The results from these cases support the utility of this cytologic technique in combination with biopsy in this clinical setting. "
neoplasms,"Intraoperative pressure profile measurement and continence mechanism adjustment in the Indiana pouch urinary reservoir. We have described herein a simple pressure transducer system which helps the surgeon to tailor suture placement and achieve a continent ileocecal reservoir. It seems that fewer Lembert sutures than previously recommended are necessary to create a continent reservoir, although further study is needed. "
neoplasms,Pachyonychia congenita complicated by hidradenitis suppurativa: a family study. A family is described in which five of the six members with the Jackson-Lawler type of pachyonychia congenita also had varying degrees of hidradenitis suppurativa. We suggest an association between this type of pachyonychia congenita and hidradenitis suppurativa. 
neoplasms,Presentation of breast carcinoma as Volkmann's contracture due to skeletal muscle metastases. Metastases to the skeletal muscles are extremely rare. They usually occur during the course of a pulmonary or digestive carcinoma. We describe a case of breast carcinoma presenting with forearm muscle metastases and Volkmann's type contracture. 
neoplasms,"Radioimmunoscintigraphy using iodine-131-anti-CEA monoclonal antibodies and thallium-201 scintigraphy in medullary thyroid carcinoma: a case report. This case report demonstrates the use of thallium-201 (201Tl) scans versus iodine-131- (131l) anti-CEA F(ab')2 scans in a patient with high serum CEA levels due to metastases of medullary thyroid carcinoma in the suprarenal region and sacroiliacal region. Scintigraphy using monoclonal antibodies directed against CEA showed a higher tumor uptake (0.26% dose and 0.64% dose, respectively) than a thallium scan and is believed to be promising for future radiotherapeutic applications. "
neoplasms,"Black-white differences in cancer prevention knowledge and behavior. Data from the 1987 National Health Interview Survey Cancer Control Supplement were used to estimate multivariate logistic regression models of diet change, mammography utilization, stool blood test utilization, and smoking. Predictor variables included race, sex, age, income, dietary concerns, and four knowledge-related variables: education and three measures of cancer prevention knowledge. When knowledge variables were included in the models, race was not a significant predictor of behavior, with one exception: among women, Blacks were found to smoke less than Whites. "
neoplasms,"Benign parotid tumour enucleation--a reliable operation in selected cases. The method of surgical treatment for benign tumours of the parotid gland had not yet been rationalized, but many authors recommend parotidectomy as the most appropriate procedure. A series of 289 operations for parotid swelling is reported; the majority of mixed and Warthin's tumours underwent enucleation without either complications or recurrence. The rationale of parotidectomy versus enucleation is discussed but in fast growing, deeply infiltrating and recurrent tumours, parotidectomy appears to be the best choice. In the other group of more commonly occurring tumours, enucleation represents a reliable time saving option. "
neoplasms,Rupture of a benign mediastinal teratoma into the right pleural cavity. A 27-year-old woman with a ruptured mediastinal cystic teratoma had high levels of amylase and carcinoembryonic antigen in cystic fluid. The activity of the amylase is thought to be the most likely cause of the rupture. High levels of carcinoembryonic antigen in pleural fluid are not necessarily indicative of a malignant lesion but may suggest the presence of a ruptured teratoma in patients with mediastinal tumors. 
neoplasms,"Tyrosine-rich crystalloids in a polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma. A polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma with tyrosine-rich crystalloid deposits is reported. The literature is reviewed, and diagnostic and histogenetic implications of this finding are discussed. "
neoplasms,"Colon carcinoma associated with ureterosigmoidostomy. A patient developing a colonic adenoma 38 years following ureterosigmoidostomy is presented. The mechanisms of neoplastic transformation associated with ureterosigmoidostomy is now better understood. This knowledge is being applied to develop modifications both of the surgical technique and the management of patients with this form of urinary diversion, and is a subject of discussion. "
neoplasms,"Management of primary nonrenal parenchymal malignancies with vena caval thrombus. We report our experience with the management of 7 primary nonrenal parenchymal malignancies with vena caval tumor thrombus. Included are 3 cases of adrenal cortical carcinoma and 1 each of transitional cell carcinoma, embryonal cell testicular carcinoma, pheochromocytoma and primary small cell carcinoma of the lung with metastases to the kidney. Surgical treatment and followup are presented, as well as a review of the literature. An aggressive surgical approach is warranted because prolonged survivals free of disease are possible. "
neoplasms,"Synchronous Hodgkin's disease and myelofibrosis terminating with granulocytic sarcoma and acute megakaryocytic leukemia. Our patient had stage IIIAI Hodgkin's disease with synchronous myelofibrosis and myeloid metaplasia. A slowly progressive myeloproliferative disease developed over 9 1/2 years and terminated in a painful osteolytic bone disease, spinal extradural granulocytic sarcoma and acute megakaryocytic leukemia. It is likely that this was a result of the myeloproliferative disease rather than a late complication from combination chemotherapy. Our case demonstrates the importance of a curative approach to Hodgkin's disease even in the face of a coexistent disease with a long or unknown natural history. "
neoplasms,"Tricuspid valve papillary fibroelastoma: echocardiographic characterization. We report a tricuspid valve papillary fibroelastoma initially detected by transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography and subsequently characterized by transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography. The mass was excised during open heart operation, and the diagnosis was verified grossly and histopathologically. Transesophageal echocardiography usually provides images far superior to those from transthoracic echocardiography and may be a useful adjunct for intraoperative localization of intracardiac tumors for excision. "
neoplasms,Benign cystic teratoma manifested as an umbilical hernia. We have reported a case of dermoid tumor manifested as an umbilical hernia. Resection led to complete recovery. 
neoplasms,Magnetic resonance imaging of radiation optic neuropathy. Three patients with delayed radiation optic neuropathy after radiation therapy for parasellar neoplasms underwent magnetic resonance imaging. The affected optic nerves and chiasms showed enlargement and focal gadopentetate dimeglumine enhancement. The magnetic resonance imaging technique effectively detected and defined anterior visual pathway changes of radionecrosis and excluded the clinical possibility of visual loss because of tumor recurrence. 
neoplasms,"Laparoscopic management of ovarian cysts. One hundred two women with ovarian cysts were managed laparoscopically over a 13-year period. Thirteen were treated with laparoscopic inspection followed by laparotomy, 6 with laparoscopic fine needle aspiration followed by laparotomy and 83 with laparoscopic fenestration and biopsy, with or without coagulation or removal of the cyst lining. Satisfactory results were noted in patients treated completely with laparoscopy. Only 1 of 56 functional, simple or paraovarian cysts recurred during the study period. Two of the 18 ovarian endometriomas treated with fenestration and coagulation or removal of the lining recurred, whereas 8 of 9 such lesions recurred when treated with fenestration alone. There were no surgical complications. "
neoplasms,"In vitro and in vivo consequences of VLA-2 expression on rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Cloned integrin alpha 2 subunit complementary DNA was expressed on human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells to give a functional VLA-2 (alpha 2 beta 1) adhesion receptor. The VLA-2-positive RDA2 cells not only showed increased adhesion to collagen and laminin in vitro, but also formed substantially more metastatic tumor colonies in nude mice after either intravenous or subcutaneous injection. These results show that a specific adhesion receptor (VLA-2) can markedly enhance both experimental and spontaneous metastasis. In contrast to the metastasis results, there was no difference in either the in vitro growth rate or apparent in vivo tumorigenicity of RD and RDA2 cells. "
neoplasms,Outpatient flexible cystoscopy and fulguration of recurrent superficial bladder tumors. Flexible cystoendoscopy and fulguration were used in the outpatient management of 185 patients with superficial bladder tumors followed for 24 months. This method provided optimal surveillance for recurrence and successful tumor control in selected cases. 
neoplasms,"Intrapericardial infusion of 5-fluorouracil. An unusual complication of a Hickman catheter. Venous access devices (VAD) have become an important tool in the management of patients with cancer. Multiple complications can occur as a consequence of insertion of a VAD. The authors report a case of a Hickman catheter perforating the wall of the superior vena cava into the pericardium, resulting in accidental intrapericardial infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias developed, but the patient did not have cardiac tamponade. She recovered from the event without apparent chronic cardiac dysfunction. "
neoplasms,"Lower extremity weakness as the initial manifestation of lung cancer [published erratum appears in Arch Phys Med Rehabil 1991 Jan;72(1):61] A 55-year-old woman had progressive lower extremity weakness. She had an 80-pack-per-year history of cigarette smoking. Electromyographic findings were consistent with the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Despite a normal chest x-ray, normal laboratory studies, and negative bronchoscopy, investigation for lung cancer was pursued. The final thoracotomy and pathology reports indicated a diagnosis of oat cell carcinoma. After treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, clinical and electrophysiologic findings have resolved. Two years after diagnosis, the patient remains in good health without evidence of recurrence. "
neoplasms,"Deletion of Alu sequences in the fifth c-sis intron in individuals with meningiomas. An abnormality in the c-sis protooncogene was identified in leukocyte DNA from members of a family predisposed to the development of meningioma, and was found to be associated with the development of the tumor in those individuals. Molecular analysis of this abnormality demonstrated a deletion within the fifth intron of the c-sis gene. The normal c-sis gene has an Alu sequence in this region which includes two perfect 130 nucleotide repeated sequences separated by 5 bp. The deleted c-sis allele is missing precisely one copy of the 130 bp repeat and the intervening 5 bp. An identical deletion was also found in DNA from 1 of 13 sporadic meningiomas. "
neoplasms,"Extended retrolabyrinthine transtentorial approach to petroclival lesions. In this communication, an extension of the retrolabyrinthine approach that has permitted safe, effective access to the petrous tip and clivus is presented. The basic technique involved complete mastoidectomy, preservation of the middle and inner ear structures, removal of the sigmoid and middle fossa plates, middle and posterior fossa craniotomies, ligation of the superior petrosal sinus, and division of the tentorium. Nine cases that exemplified the versatility of this approach constituted the basis of this paper: 2 cholesteatomas, 2 basilar artery aneurysms, 2 chordomas, and 3 meningiomas. The indications for, and complications of, this method have been discussed. "
neoplasms,"Patient perceptions. The cancer patient's perceptions about treatment, prognosis, and long-term care have emerged in the context of interaction with the changing healthcare system. A brief overview of cancer patients' perceptions regarding their disease and subsequent care is provided. The economic, organizational, and technological environment in which this care is provided and the patient's perceptions of that environment are discussed. In addition to economic pressures, the ever-increasing number of cancer patients, prolonged survival, and patients' perceptions have created changes in the healthcare system. These changes are mediated by important socioeconomic, cultural, and demographic characteristics of the cancer patient. Recommendations to address these changes are discussed. "
neoplasms,"The use of bromodeoxyuridine cytokinetic studies as a prognostic indicator of cancer of the head and neck. Traditional measures of head and neck tumors often fail to predict patient outcome or clinical course, particularly in nonadvanced disease. This problem of unpredictable tumor behavior has been one focus of cell proliferation studies. Such studies, however, have been limited by difficult methodology. A newer method of quantifying tumor cell proliferation using bromodeoxyuridine is applicable for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, as shown in the present study. The relative ease with which cell proliferation can be evaluated using this technique will allow large numbers of head and neck tumors to be studied, enabling correlations with tumor behavior to be made. "
neoplasms,"The child with recurrent solid tumor. A significant percentage of relapse occurs in children with solid tumors despite advances in treatment. This article discusses reasons for failure of primary therapy, evaluation of the relapsed patient, treatment of the relapsed patient, as well as questionable cancer therapies and therapy cessation. "
neoplasms,"Spinal glioblastomas: report of seven cases and review of the literature. Intramedullary glioblastomas are uncommon tumors. They occur chiefly in the cervicothoracic segments, have a slight tendency to occur in the early decades of life, and have a short clinical history before diagnosis. We report seven cases and discuss the salient features of these tumors, particularly the pathological features and treatment, in light of the relevant literature. "
neoplasms,"Healing of a large nonossifying fibroma after grafting with bone matrix and marrow. A case report. Healing of a large tibial nonossifying fibroma in a 12-year-old girl occurred following excision, curettage, and filling of the bony defect with human demineralized bone matrix powder mixed with a small quantity of the patient's bone marrow. The use of this graft composite was successful in the treatment of the lesion and reduced the potential risk and morbidity associated with pediatric orthopedic surgical procedures with autogeneic iliac crest and other bone grafts. "
neoplasms,"Update: prostate cancer. Prostate cancer represents a major health-care issue for older men. Recent technical advances in imaging, serum markers, and treatment hold great promise. Further insight into the natural history and biologic potential of this ubiquitous neoplasm is necessary before we can make rational decisions about early detection and newer treatment approaches. "
neoplasms,Concurrent intradural and extradural meningiomas of the cervical spine. A case of an extradural spinal meningioma presenting with a separate intradural meningioma at the same cord level is reported. Review of the English literature on spinal epidural meningiomas reveals a high incidence of concurrent intradural tumors in patients with epidural meningiomas. This leads to the conclusion that the intradural space should be evaluated carefully when an epidural meningioma is encountered. 
neoplasms,Osteoma of the middle ear. Osteomas involving the middle ear and causing a functional disturbance are rare. We report a case of a patient with an osteoma arising from the lateral semicircular canal. The main symptom was vertigo and to halt this the defect of the canal was obliterated with a bone chip and fibrin glue after removal of the tumour. 
neoplasms,"Periurethral colonic-type polyp simulating urethral caruncle. A case report. A 50-year-old, black woman presented with a 1-cm, polypoid lesion on the posterior edge of the urethral meatus that had the gross appearance of a urethral caruncle. The histologic features, however, revealed a superficially ulcerated lesion composed of colonic-type mucosal glands with focal regenerative atypia in response to inflammation. A similar histologic pattern is also found in so-called solitary rectal ulcer syndrome and inflammatory cloacogenic polyps arising in the anorectal area. Based upon an English-language literature review, this case appears to be the second reported one of an intestinal-type polyp in this location. The patient had no further problems after excisional biopsy. "
neoplasms,"Surgical management of carcinoid heart disease Metastatic carcinoid tumor is often seen with flushing, diarrhea, and cardiac symptoms--the carcinoid syndrome. Cardiac failure is often associated with major morbidity and mortality in carcinoid disease. In this report, a case of successful cardiac valvar surgical intervention has resulted in prolonged alleviation of cardiac symptoms and survival. "
neoplasms,"Comparison of methods for checking surgical margins. Surgical margins of a cutaneous neoplasm can be evaluated by various combinations of three major types of sections: vertical (perpendicular), horizontal (parallel), and oblique (Mohs method). Vertical sections may run transversely through tumor (breadloaf method), longitudinally through tumor (breadloaf-cross method), or peripheral to the tumor. The peripheral (perimeter) sectioning methods are the only methods that can evaluate almost 100% of the margin, but they have the disadvantage of not showing the relationship of the tumor to its margin, which can be seen clearly with the vertical transverse sections. Seven methods of checking surgical margins are compared and contrasted. None of these is judged to be perfect or best. "
neoplasms,"A signet-ring cell carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater. We describe a variant of carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater, which, to our knowledge, has not been previously described. Classic signet-ring cells represented the predominant cell type, and were admixed with more poorly differentiated tumor cells that were chromogranin positive. These findings raise the possibility of an amphicrine tumor of the ampulla. "
neoplasms,"Ewing's sarcoma. Radiotherapy versus surgery for local control. Significant strides in the treatment of Ewing's sarcoma, the second most common bone tumor of childhood, have resulted in cure for approximately 50% of patients. Successful therapy requires systemic chemotherapy for the eradication of microscopic or overt metastatic disease and surgery or irradiation therapy for control of the primary lesion. The article debates the controversy over the extent to which surgical resection should play a role in the local management of this disease. "
neoplasms,"Comparative in vitro activities of newer quinolones against Pseudomonas species and Xanthomonas maltophilia isolated from patients with cancer. The in vitro susceptibilities of three Pseudomonas species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas fluorescens) and Xanthomonas maltophilia to quinolone antimicrobial agents were determined. Several newer agents, particularly PD117558, PD117596, PD127391, sparfloxacin (AT-4140), A-56620, and temafloxacin, were active against Pseudomonas species. X. maltophilia isolates were generally less susceptible than were Pseudomonas isolates but were inhibited by some of the newer quinolones. "
neoplasms,"Giant benign mesenchymoma of the breast. The term mesenchymoma refers to a group of mixed tumors that are composed of two or more mesenchymal elements, excluding fibrous tissue, not ordinarily found together within the same tumor. Mesenchymomas occur most commonly in the renal and perirenal regions with rare occurrence in the breast. We describe what to our knowledge is the first report of a giant benign mesenchymoma of the breast. The clinical presentation, course, and treatment of a patient with this condition is discussed. Clinicians should be aware that benign mesenchymomas may involve the breast and simulate a malignant breast neoplasm. "
neoplasms,"Vagal schwannoma associated with syncopal attacks and postural hypotension: a case report. A case of vagal schwannoma in the cerebellomedullary angle is reported. Preoperatively, the patient had paroxysmal episodes of postural hypotension with syncope. After total removal of the vagal tumor, her systemic blood pressure returned to normal. "
neoplasms,"Glomus tumor of the coccyx. A curable cause of coccygodynia. A 30-year-old woman presented with recurrent severe coccygodynia. She underwent exploration for a possible pilonidal sinus and was found to have a precoccygeal glomus tumor that also involved bony trabeculae of the coccyx. To our knowledge, a glomus tumor involving the coccygeal bone has not been previously documented. In view of the relief of this patient's pain following the surgical excision of coccyx and tumor, a causal role is suggested. "
neoplasms,"Adrenal carcinosarcoma. The clinical and pathologic features of a case of adrenal carcinosarcoma are reported. Although synchronous malignancy of the adrenal gland has been described, no case of an adrenal tumor combining both carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements has been previously documented. This neoplasm is extremely aggressive with distant metastasis arising from the sarcomatous component, and rapid progression despite multimodal therapy. "
neoplasms,"Gleason's histologic grading as clinical prognostic marker in patients with advanced prostatic carcinoma. We have found that the Gleason's histologic grading system is a good clinical marker to predict long-term response and prognosis in symptomatic Stage D-2 adenocarcinoma of the prostate. In this retrospective study, 56 cases were reviewed and correlated with bone scan, acid phosphatase, and symptomatology following bilateral orchiectomy. "
neoplasms,"Magnetic resonance imaging of fourth ventricular epidermoid tumors. Two pathologically proved cases of epidermoid tumor of the fourth ventricle are presented; clinical history and computed tomographic, magnetic resonance imaging, and histopathologic findings are included. "
neoplasms,The use of interferon alpha-C in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma arising in a congenital solitary kidney. Three cases of renal cell carcinoma in a congenital solitary kidney are presented. Treatment with recombinant interferon alpha-C was administered in two cases. A subjective response occurred in one case. The literature is reviewed with respect to treatment options and prognostic factors. 
neoplasms,"Primary renal lymphoma. Lymphoma arising in the kidney is rare. Although 31 cases have been reported in the literature, it is likely that most of these neoplasms do not arise in the kidney. This report describes two cases of primary renal lymphoma and compares their clinical presentation, diagnostic modalities, treatment, and survival with the previously reported patients who satisfied our criteria for the diagnosis of primary renal lymphoma. "
neoplasms,Familial multiple desmoplastic trichoepitheliomas. A kindred with familial multiple desmoplastic trichoepitheliomas is described. Desmoplastic trichoepitheliomas should be added to the group of lesions that indicate an inherited pattern when they occur as multiple primary tumors. The implications for nosologic status and treatment of desmoplastic trichoepitheliomas are considered. 
neoplasms,"Detection of colorectal liver metastases using intraoperative ultrasonography. Intraoperative ultrasonography of the liver has been carried out in 99 patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. Palpation of the liver, preoperative abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography scanning were also performed in all patients. Metastases were identified in 26 of the 99 patients (26 per cent). Intraoperative ultrasonography diagnosed more metastases than palpation, abdominal ultrasonography or CT scanning, identifying metastases in 24 of the 26 patients, including six patients in whom the metastases were not detected by any other technique. Identification and localization of impalpable liver metastases is therefore possible using intraoperative ultrasonography. "
neoplasms,"Cadherin cell adhesion receptors as a morphogenetic regulator. Cadherins are a family of cell adhesion receptors that are crucial for the mutual association of vertebrate cells. Through their homophilic binding interactions, cadherins play a role in cell-sorting mechanisms, conferring adhesion specificities on cells. The regulated expression of cadherins also controls cell polarity and tissue morphology. Cadherins are thus considered to be important regulators of morphogenesis. Moreover, pathological examinations suggest that the down-regulation of cadherin expression is associated with the invasiveness of tumor cells. "
neoplasms,"Spinal cord hemangioblastoma with subarachnoid hemorrhage. A case of subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a cervical hemangioblastoma is presented. The clinical picture was indistinguishable from that of a subarachnoid hemorrhage from an intracranial lesion. The diagnosis was established by angiography and water-soluble contrast myelography followed by cervical computed tomographic scan. At surgery, the tumor was completely removed, and no neurological deficit was observed after the operation. "
neoplasms,"Renal cell metastases versus liver hemangioma. We present the case of a man with presumed metastatic renal cell carcinoma based on radiologic examination and weight loss, who refused treatment of any kind for one year. A surgical exploration to control hematuria revealed a Stage I tumor. "
neoplasms,"Suprasellar pituitary adenoma arising from the pars tuberalis: case report. A rare case of suprasellar pituitary adenoma arising from the pars tuberalis in a 53-year-old woman is presented. The tumor was located exclusively above the diaphragma sellae, and no invasion into the sella turcica was noted. "
neoplasms,"Early diagnosis of breast cancer. Universal screening is essential. Breast cancer strikes 1 in 10 women in the United States. Early diagnosis of breast cancer improves chances of survival. With universal screening and expert evaluation of early clinical signs and symptoms of breast cancer, mortality rates can be reduced by 30% to 40%. Physicians can help achieve this goal by taking an active role in patient education and promoting the availability of affordable screening mammography. "
neoplasms,"What to do when an x-ray film suggests lung cancer. The chest film is one of the most common methods of detecting lung cancer, which often appears as solitary nodules or hilar masses. Once the diagnosis is established, the most effective treatment can be determined and staging of the tumor can be done. Surgical resection is the only cure for non-small-cell carcinoma, although radiotherapy and chemotherapy may shrink some tumors. Because 90% of all cases are caused by smoking, a preventive approach to the disease is crucial. Screening of high-risk patients (ie, smokers with airflow obstruction) using chest films and sputum cytology may aid this approach. "
neoplasms,"A novel metalloproteinase gene specifically expressed in stromal cells of breast carcinomas. A gene has been identified that is expressed specifically in stromal cells surrounding invasive breast carcinomas. On the basis of its sequence, the product of this gene, named stromelysin-3, is a new member of the family of metalloproteinase enzymes which degrade the extracellular matrix. The suggestion is that stromelysin-3 is one of the stroma-derived factors that have long been postulated to play an important part in progression of epithelial malignancies. "
neoplasms,"Management of superficial G2 (pTa and pT1) bladder cancer. A total of 143 patients with superficial G2 (pTa, pT1) bladder cancer (48 G2pTa; 95 G2pT1) presenting between 1970 through 1987 were reviewed. Of 48 patients with G2pTa followed for up to eighteen years, G3 recurrence developed only in 1 (2.0%), and invasive cancer (greater than pT2) developed only in 2 (4.2%). They both received radiotherapy and have responded completely. There have been no cancer-related deaths. In contrast, in the 95 patients in whom the basement membrane had been breached (pT1), higher grade tumor (G3) developed in 11 (11.5%), and 15 (16%) had recurrences with invasion of muscle (greater than pT2). Among these there were 7 (7.3%) cancer-related deaths. "
neoplasms,"Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis: clinico-pathological correlations. Three new cases of limbic encephalitis in association with malignancy are reported. The literature on this condition is reviewed and the clinical, laboratory and histopathological features of cases proven at necropsy are correlated. The possible pathogenic mechanism of this disorder is discussed. "
neoplasms,"Selection of therapy for stage III breast cancer. Locally advanced breast cancer is a heterogenous group including both operable and inoperable lesions. Local surgery or radiation alone produces poor survival rates, indicating micrometastases at diagnosis. Systemic chemotherapy as part of multimodality regimens has increased the length and rate of disease-free survival. "
neoplasms,"Prognosticators of second-look laparotomy findings in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Prognosticators of outcome at second-look laparotomy (SLL) were evaluated in 49 patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma undergoing SLL. Residual tumor volume was found to be the most significant prognosticator of outcome, with initial tumor stage being of secondary importance. Grade of tumor played no role in outcome at SLL. The results of the study led us to the conclusion that the second-look procedure may be safely omitted in stage I patients. The importance of optimal cytoreduction during primary surgery was stressed. "
neoplasms,"Endoprosthetic reconstruction after bone tumor resections of the proximal tibia. The advent of successful adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy protocols for primary malignant tumors and the development of custom-designed metallic endoprostheses has now made possible a successful limb salvage procedure for malignancies of the proximal tibia. Use of the transposed medial gastrocnemius flap, as proposed by Dr. Jean Duboussett of Paris, has been critical to the soft-tissue reconstruction that routinely permits an excellent active and passive range of motion for these patients. This article describes the operative techniques and technical considerations necessary for a successful proximal tibial endoprosthesis reconstruction. "
neoplasms,"Multifocal, synchronous inverted papillomas involving the ureter. Inverted papillomas involving the upper urinary tract remain a rarely diagnosed phenomenon. A case of bilateral ureteral inverted papillomas is presented. The treatment and diagnosis of this lesion remain a challenge. "
neoplasms,"Recent advances in etoposide therapy for non-small cell lung cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) continues to be a major health problem in the US. In 1990, approximately 120,000 new cases will be diagnosed, and the majority of these patients will have either unresectable disease or resected disease that has a relatively low chance of being cured. A variety of chemotherapy treatments have been evaluated in patients with advanced NSCLC. The objective of this review is to summarize the results of the chemotherapy trials in Stage III and IV NSCLC patients. "
neoplasms,Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the prostate with endobronchial metastasis. Endobronchial metastases can manifest clinical symptoms and x-ray findings mimicking a centrally located bronchogenic carcinoma. The authors recently encountered a case of endobronchial metastasis from a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the prostate that was originally diagnosed as a primary bronchogenic carcinoma. The correct diagnosis was made on the basis of the morphologic similarities between the primary prostatic lesion and the lung lesion and was corroborated by immunohistochemical analyses. 
neoplasms,"Forty years of neuroglycopenia: neuropsychiatry for the internist. The case of a 65-year-old patient with an insulin-secreting pancreatic tumour and a 40-year history of neuropsychiatric disease is reported. The physiopathology and clinical features of acute, subacute, and chronic neuroglycopenia in patients with endogenous insulin hypersecretion are discussed. "
neoplasms,"Nephrotic syndrome complicating adenocarcinoma of the lung with resolution after resection. Nephrotic syndrome is an uncommon complication of lung cancer. We present a case in which adenocarcinoma was complicated by the nephrotic syndrome, which resolved after resection of the cancer. "
neoplasms,Prostate-specific antigen for staging prior to surgery and for early detection of recurrence after surgery. The exact usefulness of prostate-specific antigen for staging before radical prostatectomy is still unclear. Perhaps the marker's most exciting feature is its value in detecting residual disease after radical prostatectomy. The author also discusses the technical questions in testing and interpretation. 
neoplasms,"A predominantly adrenaline-secreting phaeochromocytoma. A 61-year-old woman who presented with diabetes, nausea, weight loss and sweating was found to have a phaeochromocytoma secreting adrenaline, with a small amount of N-methyladrenaline. There was no significant increase in noradrenaline secretion. She was normotensive, and developed profound hypotension in response to the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine. These features are unusual in phaeochromocytoma, but similar features occurred in the very few previous reported cases of pure adrenaline-secreting phaeochromocytoma. We conclude that it is important to identify such patients, so that they should not be given alpha-adrenergic antagonist drugs. "
neoplasms,"Successful Fontan-type operation for a nonresectable right ventricular tumor. A large intracavitary right ventricular tumor in a 24-year-old patient was considered nonresectable because it involved the interventricular septum, the free ventricular walls, and the tricuspid valve. Surgical palliation consisted of closure of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves, and the right atrium was anastomosed to the pulmonary artery bifurcation. The patient is asymptomatic 7 years after operation, and the neoplasm (a rhabdomyoma) has not increased in size. "
neoplasms,"Surgical strategy for early gastric cancer. The diagnostic and therapeutic options in early gastric cancer are reviewed. In Japan, the rate of detection of early gastric cancers has increased so that minute gastric cancers can now be identified as a result of advances in diagnostic methods. The results of histopathological staging of a large number of resected specimens have led to three surgical options based on size and depth of the primary lesion, namely classical R2 resection, radical resection with limited lymphadenectomy and endoscopic surgery. "
neoplasms,Bilateral papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum of the parotid gland without accumulation of technetium 99m pertechnetate: report of a case and review of the literature. An unusual case of bilateral papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum of the parotid with multiple lesions showing no active uptake of 99mTc pertechnetate is presented. Similar cases showing no accumulation of radionuclide are reviewed. 
neoplasms,"A clinical triad to diagnose paraneoplastic retinopathy. Two elderly men developed photosensitivity and light-induced glare, transient visual symptoms, and progressive visual loss several months before small cell carcinoma of the lung was discovered. Both patients had impaired visual acuity and color vision, ring scotomas, and attenuated retinal arteriole caliber. Electroretinography demonstrated abnormal cone and rod-mediated responses. Antiretinal antibodies were identified in their serum. Their visual sensory function improved following therapy with immunosuppressive agents. The triad of photosensitivity, ring scotomatous visual field loss, and attenuated retinal arteriole caliber should alert one to a paraneoplastic disorder affecting the retina. "
neoplasms,"Bilateral familial carotid body paragangliomas. Report of a case with DNA flow cytometric and cytogenetic analyses. A case study of bilateral familial carotid body paragangliomas with DNA flow cytometric and cytogenetic analyses is presented. Analysis of tumor cell nuclear DNA content by flow cytometry revealed aneuploid cell populations in both tumors. Standard cytogenetic analysis (Giemsa-banding technique used) of the right carotid body paraganglioma showed no evidence of numerical or structural abnormalities. We describe parameters currently used to ""predict"" biological behavior in these tumors. "
neoplasms,"Technetium-99m (v) dimercaptosuccinic acid: a clinical and scintigraphic study in an animal tumour model. Technetium-99m (99mTc) (v) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is a new tumour-imaging agent which has been used to image head and neck squamous carcinoma. This study used an established rabbit tumour model to compare palpation versus planar scintigraphy in the detection of superficially transplanted cancers. Palpation detected 83% of tumours measuring less than 2 cm compared with 58% for scintigraphy. Overall, the sensitivity for palpation was 88% (77% specificity) compared with 50% (63% specificity) for scintigraphy. "
neoplasms,"The nursing role in limb salvage surgery. Limb salvage surgery has proven itself as a valuable option for sarcoma patients. The reconstruction options are vast and include metallic implants, allografts, and a combination of both. The nursing implications for these patients are unlimited. The patient needs to be educated and assessed closely for complications such as infections, nonunion of the allograft, and limited mobility. Although the nursing care is more complicated, the rewards with working with these patients are great. "
neoplasms,Large cystic optic glioma. A 5 1/2-year-old boy developed a huge cyst in his chiasmal glioma 4 years after radiation therapy. The cyst produced obtundation but was successfully treated. 
neoplasms,Epidermoid cyst (monodermal teratoma) of the testis. We report 14 patients with epidermoid cyst of the testis (monodermal teratoma). In 7 patients (5 treated within the last 5 years) the mass was excised and adjacent testicular tissue was biopsied. Seven patients underwent radical inguinal orchiectomy. Carcinoma in situ was not detected in any testicular tissue examined. There was no evidence of tumour recurrence in any patient after a mean follow-up of 10 years. Ultrasonographic appearance was not specific for a diagnosis of epidermoid cyst and exploratory surgery was required in all cases. Excision of the tumour and biopsy of adjacent testicular tissue to determine the presence or absence of carcinoma in situ is adequate treatment for this rare testicular neoplasm. 
neoplasms,"Implementation of preventive services in an HMO practice. Practice does not conform to guidelines unless the guidelines are specifically implemented and performance is monitored. Several examples of implementation in one health maintenance organization (HMO) are given. These include immunization for influenza and follow up of positive screening tests for colorectal and cervical cancer. Each implementation effort has required the development of systems, which in this HMO are automated. Several issues influencing implementation are discussed, including resource constraints and priorities for the allocation of new resources. Developers cannot expect that their guidelines will be incorporated into clinical practice. They must foster specific implementation plans. "
neoplasms,"Long term effects of gastrocystoplasty in rats. Twenty prepubescent rats underwent microsurgical gastrocystoplasty by a technique which is described. An equal number of control rats had their bladders opened and closed. Rats were sacrificed at 16 to 18 months postoperatively. There were no differences in final weight, serum electrolytes, or renal function between the two groups. Prominent histopathologic changes of the bladder occurred in the gastrocystoplasty group. These changes included papillomas present in five of the 15 rats surviving long term. No significant changes occurred in the bladders of the control group of rats. Possible etiologies and the significance of the rats. Possible etiologies and the significance of the gastrocystoplasty related lesions are discussed. "
neoplasms,"The ""numb cheek-limp lower lid"" syndrome. A patient developed isolated numbness, 1st confined to the lateral nose and upper lip, but later involving the cheek, lower lip, upper gingiva, and the palate. This numbness was later associated with paresis of the muscles of the upper lip and angle of the mouth and with ipsilateral lower lid droop (the ""numb cheek-limp lower lid"" syndrome). Squamous cell carcinoma was discovered infiltrating the infraorbital nerve and distal branches of the facial nerve. Cheek numbness associated with lower eyelid or upper lip weakness may herald a neoplasm affecting the infraorbital nerve and distal facial nerve branches. "
neoplasms,"A case of massive true thymic hyperplasia with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A case of massive true thymic hyperplasia with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the mediastinum is reported in a 14-year-old boy. Computed tomographic scan of the chest showed a mass of the anterior mediastinum and conspicuous swelling of the lymph nodes in the upper and lower mediastinum. They were grossly resected. The tumor of the anterior mediastinum was histologically diagnosed as true thymic hyperplasia. All of the mediastinal lymph nodes were diagnosed as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, diffuse, mixed small and large cell type. "
neoplasms,"Radiation therapy of laryngeal cancer: a twenty year experience. This paper reviews a 20 year experience of radiation treatment of 286 laryngeal cancers and presents results with a minimum five year follow-up. All cases presented had glottic or supraglottic squamous cell carcinomas with no clinical evidence of nodal metastasis. A policy of primary radiotherapy with surgery for salvage of treatment failures, produced control of primary disease and prevention of metastases superior to most other regimes documented in the literature. "
neoplasms,"Needle aspiration and pressure sutures for auricular pseudocyst. Auricular pseudocyst is an asymptomatic cystic swelling of the upper portion of the auricle. Various therapeutic approaches have been employed with variable success. We report our results with nine patients treated by needle aspiration and bolstered pressure sutures applied over both aspects of the cyst for 1 week. Treatment resulted in complete resolution with no recurrence of the lesion in any of the patients. This procedure is simple, does not require an operating room setting, and is more comfortable and more acceptable aesthetically by the patient. "
neoplasms,"Intraosseous lipoma within the femoral head. A case report. Intraosseous lipoma occurring within the femoral head seems not to have been previously reported. Symptoms associated with the tumor included slowly increasing pain and a cystic lesion shown on roentgenograms. Management was by total hip arthroplasty. Pathologic examination of the specimen showed that the tumor was composed almost entirely of mature adipose tissue in keeping with a diagnosis of Stage 1 intraosseous lipoma. A sclerotic border and osteoid seams were noted, two features that seem not to have been previously reported in early lesions. Recent papers suggest intraosseous lipomas are more common than previously thought, and the femur now accounts for 25% of reported cases. "
neoplasms,"Paratesticular myxoma: an unusual benign intrascrotal neoplasm. We have presented a case of paratesticular myxoma and have described the clinical history, findings on light microscopy and immunohistochemistry, and possible pathogenesis. Although primary paratesticular myxoma is a rare lesion, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intrascrotal mesenchymal tumors. "
neoplasms,"Bronchogenic carcinoma in situ on the carina eradicated by endobronchial biopsy. Squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the bronchus is a rare disorder in an isolated clinical setting. We present a case of carcinoma in situ located on the carina with excisional biopsy via a fiberoptic bronchoscope and no recurrence after five years. To our knowledge, this represents the only case of carcinoma in situ treated solely with excisional biopsy. This case further emphasizes the importance of securing biopsy specimens for all mucosal abnormalities and raises the possibility of limited excision as sole therapy for carcinoma in situ. "
neoplasms,"Lambert Eaton syndrome: autonomic neuropathy and inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in a patient with small cell carcinoma of the lung. A patient with small cell carcinoma of the lung developed asymptomatic autonomic neuropathy, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion and Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome. The autonomic neuropathy and inappropriate ADH secretion were present at the time of diagnosis of the tumour. Following chemotherapy these resolved, but 5 months later the patient developed Lambert Eaton syndrome which responded to 3,4-diaminopyridine. This sequence of changes appears to be unique. "
neoplasms,"Autoimmunity and malignancy. In patients with autoimmune diseases malignancy is observed more frequently than in an age-matched control group. In strains of mice susceptible to autoimmune diseases, the incidence of lymphoreticular malignancies is increased. Although viruses have not been directly implicated in their pathogenesis or etiology, there are suggestions that slow viruses may be involved. Viruses have been found to be important in the development of lymphomas. Hence in genetically susceptible animals, viruses can initiate the autoimmune process. Prolonged stimulation of the autoimmune process or a prolonged state of immunodeficiency could trigger or activate genes or their products, which could result in the development of malignancy. "
neoplasms,"Radiation therapy of early (stages I and II-A) seminoma of testis after initial orchiectomy. With initial orchiectomy and radiation therapy, the prognosis of the patients with early (Stages I and II-A) testicular seminoma is nearing almost 100 percent. Thirty-two patients with Stage I and 13 patients with Stage II-A seminoma of the testis were treated with initial orchiectomy. This was followed by estimation biochemical markers and radiologic investigations. All the patients with Stage I disease received radiotherapy to the ipsilateral pelvic and para-aortic nodes. The patients with Stage II-A disease also received radiation therapy to the supradiaphragmatic regions. The disease-free survival in both groups of patients was found to be 100 percent. "
neoplasms,"Squamous carcinoma of the distal esophagus: a survival study. A survival study for squamous carcinomas of the distal esophagus treated by the Southern California Permanente Medical Group in the interval of 1954 to 1988 was undertaken. We found radiation therapy and surgery equally efficacious in terms of cure for patients without distant disease and performance status sufficient to tolerate treatment. We did not find survival benefit for patients treated with palliative surgery, and plan less invasive endoscopic means along with chemotherapy and radiation for palliation, reserving surgery for special circumstances. "
neoplasms,Tumor lysis syndrome in a patient with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma. A first course of combination chemotherapy for large volume metastatic disease in a patient with Merkel cell carcinoma resulted in a tumor lysis syndrome. After this course a nearly complete response was documented. This case report extends further the chemosensitivity of Merkel cell carcinoma and demonstrates the need for tumor lysis syndrome prophylaxis in patients with bulky disease or fast-growing tumors. 
neoplasms,"Preoperative radiotherapy in operable rectal cancer. The effect of preoperative radiotherapy (31.5 Gy in 3.5 weeks) in operable rectal cancer was examined with respect to resectability and prognosis after two surgical procedures, abdominoperineal resection, or low anterior resection. Preoperative radiation did not influence the surgeon's selection of low anterior resection, which was similar (40 percent) in each group. Radiation improved five-year survival probability and decreased the incidence of local recurrence significantly after low anterior resection. In contrast, no improvement of treatment results was found in patients treated by abdominoperineal resection after radiotherapy. "
neoplasms,"Perforation and tumor formation of the intestine in primary amyloidosis. We report a case of primary amyloidosis with repeated bowel perforations. This patient also had localized amyloid deposition creating a tumorous region mimicking malignancy in the rectum. Perforation of the intestine is common in systemic amyloidosis. The ischemic change due to amyloid infiltration into the vessel wall may lead to perforation of the affected bowel. Amyloid tumors occur more often in localized amyloid than in systemic amyloidosis. Macroscopically, it is difficult to distinguish amyloid tumor of the intestine from neoplasia. "
neoplasms,Adult respiratory distress syndrome after limited resection of adenocarcinoma of the lung. Two cases of the adult respiratory distress syndrome developed after limited resection for lung carcinoma. No other known precipitants were evident. The adult respiratory distress syndrome is a clinical expression of acute lung injury that may arise from various insults and include air and blood borne factors. Tumour related blood borne factors may have contributed to lung injury in these cases. 
neoplasms,Exaggerated venous mural hypertrophy in association with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate. A 61-year-old black man presented with metastases to the right groin 5 years after 125iodine treatment for a well differentiated primary prostatic adenocarcinoma. Medium sized veins within and immediately adjacent to the neoplasm showed marked mural thickening due to hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the inner circular and outer longitudinal muscles. There was no histological evidence of radiation effect in the stroma or in the tumor cells. We could find no report in the literature of such changes associated with metastatic carcinoma. 
neoplasms,"Primary adenocarcinoma of the temporal bone. A case with 40-year follow-up. Adenomatous tumors of the temporal bone are rare neoplasms. This article records the 40-year course of a patient with adenocarcinoma of the temporal bone and reviews the literature pertinent to the biologic behavior, histologic appearance, prognosis, and treatment of this group of tumors. "
neoplasms,"Scintigraphic evaluation of aggressive fibromatosis. Despite its benign microscopic appearance, aggressive fibromatosis has potential to recur and infiltrate neighboring tissues. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the exact extent before therapy. In the present study, 11 cases of aggressive fibromatosis were examined scintigraphically using [99mTc(V)]dimercaptosuccinic acid (11 cases) and 67Ga-citrate (7 cases). Technetium-99m-(V)-dimercaptosuccinic acid demonstrated all lesions, while 67Ga-citrate detected 57% of the cases. "
neoplasms,"Carcinoma of the external auditory canal: an update. This review is a continuation of the series of 35 cases of carcinoma of the external auditory canal originally reported by the senior author and colleagues. Eighteen additional cases have been evaluated and treated since 1976. Preoperative high-resolution computed tomographic scanning has replaced polytomography, and improved surgical skull base approaches have allowed for extended resections of advanced lesions. A revised classification for local and extensive lesions is presented. The prognosis for localized tumors treated by en bloc resection remains excellent, whereas prognosis for extensive lesions might be more dependent on histologic type and grade of tumor. "
neoplasms,"DNA ploidy pattern in rectal carcinoid tumors. The nuclear DNA pattern of 22 rectal carcinoids was determined by cytophotometry of paraffin embedded tissues. The results were compared with clinical as well as histopathologic features of the tumor. Three of the carcinoids with synchronous or metachronous metastasis had aneuploid DNA pattern, whereas 19 tumors with no metastasis showed diploid DNA pattern. No other single clinical or pathologic feature of the tumor could predict more accurately the malignant potential and the subsequent course of the rectal carcinoid. It is concluded that DNA aneuploidy in rectal carcinoid tumors is not so rare as indicated by earlier studies and that it is a factor of significant prognostic value. "
neoplasms,"Bladder outlet obstruction due to pelvic lipoma: computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and radiographic evaluation. We report an unusual case of long-standing bladder outlet obstruction due to pelvic lipoma in a 31-year-old white man. The mass was evaluated by plain film, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The differential diagnosis of fat-containing extraperitoneal pelvic masses is discussed. "
neoplasms,"Nonsquamous tumors of the head and neck in the geriatric population. Thyroid tumors, salivary gland tumors, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are described. Psychosocial issues involving the geriatric patient are discussed. Case reports of a number of geriatric tumor patients are included. "
neoplasms,Adult hepatic fibropolycystic disease presenting as obstructive jaundice. Obstructive jaundice caused by compression of the common hepatic duct by a simple hepatic cyst in a 31 year old Europid man is reported. The jaundice and duct compression resolved after percutaneous aspiration of the cyst under ultrasound direction and the patient has been well for 12 months. 
neoplasms,"Lack of prognostic value of nucleolar organizer region enumeration in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Enumeration of silver-stained nucleolar organizer regions is of limited use in grading transitional cell tumors of the bladder. We attempted in this article to establish whether or not such a technique would be helpful in predicting the prognosis of such tumors within rather than between grades. In the study population of 11 high-grade transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder, no correlation was found between clinical outcome and mean nucleolar organizer region count. "
neoplasms,The presence of human papillomavirus type 16 in squamous cell carcinoma of the proximal finger and reconstruction with a bilobed transposition flap. In a 71 year old white female a clinically diagnosed keratoacanthoma on the dorsum of the right third finger was removed using Mohs micrographic surgery and histologically diagnosed as a squamous cell carcinoma. It was shown by dot blot hybridization to have HPV type 16 DNA in the tumor. The wound was reconstructed with a bilobed transposition flap. 
neoplasms,"Three staged approach to the surgical management of renal cell carcinoma extending into the right atrium. Case report. Left renal cell carcinoma extending into the right atrium was treated by angioinfarction, removal of right atrial tumour using cardiopulmonary bypass and ten days later abdominal radical nephrectomy and inferior vena cava thrombectomy. Twenty four months later the patient remains well with no evidence of tumour recurrence. "
neoplasms,"Endothelin-like immunoreactivity in human breast cyst fluid. Immunoreactive endothelin has been detected in 21 of 43 samples of breast cyst fluid (21 cases; 3.5 +/- 0.6 pmol/l, mean +/- SEM. Other 22 cases; not detectable, less than 0.5 pmol/l). Fast protein liquid chromatographic analysis of the immunoreactive endothelin of pooled breast cyst fluid showed two immunoreactive peaks; one in the void volume and the other in the position of endothelin-1. It is probable that endothelin-1 is produced by the epithelial cells lining breast cysts, but significance of the presence of endothelin-1 in breast cyst fluid remains to be elucidated. "
neoplasms,Embryonal carcinoma of the testis presenting as a left heart mass. A 31-year-old man with a history of intravenous drug abuse and tooth abscess was admitted for evaluation of possible infective endocarditis. Echocardiography showed that he had a left atrial mass. The mass removed from the left atrium had the same histology as the primary embryonal carcinoma discovered in the right testicle during hospitalization. The patient made a smooth recovery after surgical intervention and chemotherapy. This is believed to be the first reported case of metastasis from embryonal carcinoma of the testis to the left side of the heart that was successfully removed at surgery. 
neoplasms,"Superficial bladder cancer in patients under 40 years of age. Efficacy of topical prophylaxis. In patients under the age of 40 years with primary superficial bladder cancer the efficacy of adjuvant topical treatment was the same as in elderly patients (recurrences 23%, progression rate 8%). Patients should therefore be treated on the basis of stage and grade of the tumour regardless of their age. "
neoplasms,A modified rhombic transposition flap and its application in dermatology. A modified rhombic transposition flap based around a circular primary defect is described. We have found it to be a versatile design that produces good cosmetic results with a low incidence of postoperative complications. It has become the most frequently used transposition flap in our dermatologic practice. 
neoplasms,"Leukemias of indeterminant lineage. Two biologically and clinically important forms of acute leukemia have been described. Evidence suggests that both undifferentiated acute leukemia and many types of hybrid leukemia arise from relatively fewer differentiated cells than do the more straightforward acute leukemias. Clinical correlations suggest that patients with these leukemias may have a poorer prognosis, although some findings may be associated with an improved prognosis. More data in which multiple techniques are applied to the same leukemic cells are clearly needed. Patients with certain types of hybrid leukemias may be suitable candidates for more aggressive forms of chemotherapy or, possibly, combinations of therapy directed at cells of both lineages. "
neoplasms,Unusual presentation of squamous cell carcinoma of the middle ear and mastoid. An unusual case of squamous cell carcinoma of the middle ear and mastoid in which syncope was a major presenting feature is reported. No such case has been reported in the literature. A possible explanation is offered. 
neoplasms,"Radionuclide imaging in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery. Radionuclide imaging provides both qualitative and quantitative information that can have dramatic effects on patient management in diseases of the head and neck. The general concepts of nuclear medicine imaging, including radiopharmaceuticals and radiation effects, are discussed. The principles and techniques of thyroid, parathyroid, bone, and salivary radionuclide imaging studies will be reviewed. The intent of this article is to provide a concise and current review of head and neck radionuclide imaging that will be useful in the day-to-day practice of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery. "
neoplasms,Parotid gland plasmacytoma with crystalline deposits. A case of primary extramedullary plasmacytoma of the parotid gland with a marked deposition of intracytoplasmic crystals is presented. The immunohistochemical and ultrastructural characteristics of the crystals suggest formation from monoclonal immunoglobulin. 
neoplasms,"Cutaneous vasculitis associated with pheochromocytoma. We describe a patient who presented with constitutional symptoms, severe hypertension, and purpuric lesions over the knees, thighs, and penis. The patient was eventually diagnosed as having multiple endocrine neoplasia type II, with cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The cutaneous vasculitis persisted despite treatment with high-dose systemic corticosteroids, but rapidly resolved after the removal of bilateral pheochromocytomas. This case demonstrates cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis in association with pheochromocytoma. "
neoplasms,"Ocular melanoma in families with dysplastic nevus syndrome. Five families with the dysplastic nevus syndrome, in each of which one member had ocular melanoma, are reported. These five families were examined within a 3-year period in one medical center. To date only five other families with such a combination have been reported. We suggest a causal relation between ocular melanoma and the familial dysplastic nevus syndrome. "
neoplasms,"Cyclosporine in the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. We present our observations on the use of cyclosporine in the treatment of three patients with mycosis fungoides and two patients with Sezary syndrome. The patients with mycosis fungoides showed mild improvement of short duration. One patient with Sezary syndrome had significant improvement during 2 years of treatment. It is unlikely that cyclosporine alone will be sufficient therapy for cutaneous T cell lymphoma. However, lower doses in conjunction with other immunomodulators may minimize potential side effects and lead to longer lasting clinical improvement. "
neoplasms,"Radiation-induced cranial nerve palsy: hypoglossal nerve and vocal cord palsies. Cranial nerve palsies are an unexpected complication of radiotherapy for head and neck tumours. We present a case of this radiation-induced cranial palsy. An 18-year-old female with nasopharyngeal carcinoma developed a right hypoglossal nerve palsy 42 months after cancericidal doses of radiotherapy. In addition, she developed a bilateral vocal cord palsy 62 months after therapy. Follow-up over four years has demonstrated no evidence of tumour recurrence and no sign of neurological improvement. "
neoplasms,"Usefulness of epidurally evoked cortical potential monitoring during cervicomedullary glioma surgery. This report describes a patient with an intramedullary ependymoma at the region of the cervicomedullary junction in whom there was an abolition of somatosensory evoked potentials following median nerve stimulation. During intraoperative monitoring of cortical potentials elicited by epidural cervical cord stimulation, the tumor was removed. Posterior epidural stimulation appeared to depolarize more ascending fibers than did stimulation of a single peripheral nerve. We recommend that, in cases of operations in this vital area, epidurally evoked cortical potentials be monitored intraoperatively. "
neoplasms,"Preventing colorectal cancer. Knowledgeable patients should not die of colorectal cancer. Increasing the intake of dietary fiber, decreasing fat consumption, and increasing the use of modern technology to detect adenomatous polyps and early cancer can greatly decrease the mortality associated with colorectal cancer. "
neoplasms,"Multiple intracranial tumors of different cell types. Multiple intracranial tumors of different cell types are rare. We report nine patients with multiple intracranial tumors, who did not have a history of trauma, irradiation, or phacomatosis. The clinical, radiological, and histopathological findings as well as indications for operations in patients with asymptomatic second tumors are discussed. "
neoplasms,"Disseminated strongyloidiasis with central nervous system involvement diagnosed antemortem in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and Burkitts lymphoma. A 45-year-old man presented with central nervous system involvement as the initial manifestation of disseminated infection with Strongyloides stercoralis. Several concurrent clinical factors contributed to this event, all related to the patient's immunosuppression, including high-grade lymphoma, corticosteroid therapy, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. This is only the third case of CNS involvement in disseminated strongyloidiasis diagnosed antemortem. "
neoplasms,"Serous papillary adenocarcinoma of the tunica vaginalis of the testis with metastasis. Testicular or paratesticular neoplasms that resemble the common epithelial type of ovarian tumor are quite rare. The authors report the case of a 29-year-old man with a metastatic serous papillary adenocarcinoma arising from the tunica vaginalis. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of a serous carcinoma of the tunica vaginalis behaving in a malignant fashion. The fact that clinically apparent metastatic disease occurred 4 years after initial presentation suggests that development of metastases is a late event. Unfortunately, the tumor has been refractory to therapy with chemotherapeutic agents with activity against ovarian malignancies. "
neoplasms,"Molecular analysis of acute promyelocytic leukemia breakpoint cluster region on chromosome 17. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; FAB M3) is characterized by a predominance of malignant promyelocytes that carry a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17, t(15;17) (q22;q11.2-q12). This translocation has become diagnostic for APL, as it is present in almost 100 percent of cases. A Not I linking clone was used to detect this translocation initially on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and subsequently with conventional Southern (DNA) analysis. The breakpoints in ten APL cases examined were shown to cluster in a 12-kb region of chromosome 17, containing two CpG-rich islands. The region is the first intron of the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene (RARA). "
neoplasms,"Primary malignant lymphoma of the bladder. We treated 11 patients with primary malignant lymphoma of the bladder. The typical patient is a woman more than 50 years old who presents with urgency and frequency of micturition, and occasionally gross hematuria. Hydronephrosis is present in half of the patients and cystoscopy usually reveals a solid tumor. Partial cystectomy, when feasible, with or without radiotherapy and chemotherapy is the usual treatment modality. When localized to the bladder, malignant lymphoma has an over-all favorable prognosis. "
neoplasms,"Respiratory epithelium in a cystic choristoma of the limbus. A female newborn had a cystic, whitish gray mass at the inferotemporal limbus of the left eye. At age 3 weeks, the newborn underwent excision of the tumor, corneal patch grafting, and superior sector optical iridectomy. Histopathologic and electron microscopic examination of the excised tissue revealed a choristoma consisting of cysts lined with respiratory epithelium. To our knowledge, respiratory epithelium in a limbal choristoma has not been previously reported. "
neoplasms,"Histopathologic grading of salivary gland neoplasms: I. Mucoepidermoid carcinomas. Histopathologic grading of salivary gland neoplasms has been done with various degrees of success and hence various degrees of acceptance among pathologists and otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons. Given their histopathologic diversity, three carcinomas--mucoepidermoid, adenoid cystic, and acinic cell--would seem to be suitable candidates for grading. In this, the first of a three-part series, the authors present a three-level grading scheme for mucoepidermoid carcinomas. It combines histocytologic and growth features of the carcinomas that independently or together, in other grading proposals, have shown prognostic value. "
neoplasms,"Mediastinal hibernoma, a rare tumor. Hibernoma is an uncommon soft tissue tumor that is derived from the remnants of fetal brown fat. Review of the world medical literature revealed 90 cases, 6 of which were intrathoracic. We present the seventh case of intrathoracic hibernoma; in this case, the hibernoma was within the mediastinum without direct invasion of other structures. "
neoplasms,"Retrovirus from human T-cell leukemia virus type I-associated myelopathy is the same strain as a prototype human T-cell leukemia virus type I. A retrovirus was isolated from a T-cell line that was established from lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with human T-cell leukemia virus type I-associated myelopathy (HAM), and its genome was sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the 3' half of the total genome was identical in 99.5% of the nucleotides to that of the prototype human T-cell leukemia virus type I that was derived from a patient with adult T-cell leukemia. These results indicate that the same retrovirus human T-cell leukemia virus type I is associated with both a neurological disease, HAM, and a lymphoproliferative disease, adult T-cell leukemia. "
neoplasms,Pregnancy after in vitro fertilization in a patient with stage I endometrial carcinoma treated with progestins. A 35-year-old woman with chronic anovulation and bilateral tubal disease was found during infertility evaluation to have grade I endometrial carcinoma confined to an endometrial polyp. She was treated with polypectomy and endometrial curettage followed by high-dose progestagens for 6 months. Endometrial curettage at 3 and 6 months of therapy indicated regression of the lesion and the patient subsequently achieved successful pregnancy with IVF. 
neoplasms,"Microcystic adnexal carcinoma following radiotherapy in childhood. A 36-year-old man was treated by radiotherapy for tinea capitis many years before discovery of microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC). Because of patient's refusal of any surgical intervention, we were able to follow the natural course of this tumor for 13 years. This case emphasizes the typical slow development of (MAC). The implication of the association of MAC and radiotherapy are discussed. "
neoplasms,Effect of microwave and ionizing radiation in patients with recurrent laryngeal carcinoma. This study describes the treatment and survival of 54 patients with gross recurrent laryngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy. Twenty-six patients were treated with local ultra-high frequency hyperthermia in combination with radiotherapy and chemotherapy (HRCH). Twenty-eight control patients were treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy (RCh). Eight patients (33 per cent) in HRCh showed a three year survival but no patient in the RCh group. At two years 18 patients (75 per cent) in HRCh and two (7 per cent) in RCh survived. 
neoplasms,"Symptomatic pineal cyst: case report. Pineal cysts are being described with increasing frequency since the advent of magnetic resonance imaging. Although pineal cysts are incidental findings in as many as 4% of magnetic resonance imaging studies, symptomatic pineal cysts are quite rare. We present a case of pineal cyst causing aqueductal obstruction with symptomatic hydrocephalus and resultant headache and syncope, which was treated by surgical resection. A review of the relevant literature and discussion follow. "
neoplasms,Common skin lesions of the elderly. The elderly patient can present with a variety of skin lesions of the head and neck. This article is designed to acquaint the otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon with normal skin morphology and with the changes that occur with aging and sun exposure. Common benign and malignant skin lesions of the aging patient are discussed. 
neoplasms,"Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver. Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver is an extremely rare entity. Because of its unusual clinical presentation and confusing histologic picture, a diagnosis of malignancy is frequently made. Thus the surgeon is closely involved with the case and extensive procedures are not uncommon. However, this lesion is benign and will even regress spontaneously, making radical surgical procedures contraindicated. The difficulty lies in establishing an accurate diagnosis and the histologic pitfalls of this particular process. Conservative therapy can then be applied, avoiding surgical morbidity. "
neoplasms,"Passage of a colon 'cast' after anoabdominal rectal resection. Report of a case. The authors report a case of the passage of a total colonic J-pouch ""cast"" per anus after anoabdominal rectal resection and colonic J-pouch-anal anastomosis. This occurred without development of cuff abscess and was not due to occlusion of the inferior mesenteric artery. This was successfully treated, with preservation of anal function, with resection of the colonic J-pouch by transanal approach. "
neoplasms,"Absence of estrogen receptors in dysplastic nevi and malignant melanoma. Benign nevi, dysplastic nevi, and primary and metastatic malignant melanomas were evaluated for the presence of sex hormone binding and estrogen receptor protein. We have confirmed the observation of Ellis et al. that some pigmented lesions possess sex hormone-binding proteins. We could not demonstrate a true estrogen receptor in any benign nevi, dysplastic nevi, primary melanomas, or metastatic melanomas. Thus the ability to bind estrogen or progesterone does not correlate with the presence of a true estrogen receptor. Lack of nuclear estrogen receptors suggests that the influence of estrogen on the pathophysiology of melanoma or of benign melanocytic nevi may not be significant. "
neoplasms,"Giant enterocystoma within an infant's tongue. A rare developmental cyst within the tongue and submandibular triangle of a male infant containing heterotopic gastric and intestinal epithelium (enterocystoma) is described and its derivation discussed. This cyst was of such a size as to cause feeding difficulties and partial airway obstruction during sleep. Following C.T. scanning, total obstruction necessitated an emergency tracheostomy. Successful enucleation via a median labiomandibulotomy was performed without further complication and two years later there is no sign of recurrence. "
neoplasms,"Occurrence of uveal melanoma in contact with a chorioretinal cryocoagulation scar. A case of a uveal melanoma arising in an eye previously treated with cryocoagulation for a horseshoe retinal tear is described. In the anterior border of the tumor, a notch, clearly fitting the curve of the chorioretinal scar was observed. Possible mechanisms which may be responsible for the local arrest of the tumor extension are discussed. "
neoplasms,"Persistent carcinoma in situ of the testis after chemotherapy for advanced testicular germ cell tumours. The chemosensitivity of testicular carcinoma in situ (CIS) was analysed in 25 testes excised 10 weeks to 4.5 years following platinum-based chemotherapy. CIS was present in 8 of the 23 evaluable cases (35%), in 5 of which the lesion coexisted with invasive germ cell tumour. It is concluded that CIS may persist or recur after chemotherapy. This has implications for occult presentation of metastatic germ cell tumours and also for the management of the contralateral testis in patients with testicular germ cell tumours. "
neoplasms,"Interventional radiology of the biliary tract. Intraductal radiation. One palliative method of treating patients with a high duct cholangiocarcinoma is the use of 192Ir wire. This is placed through the tumor, which has been previously intubated, and delivers a high local dose of radiation. The mean survival time in 30 patients treated with intraductal radiation was 16.8 months, an improvement compared to surgical bypass or endoscopic and radiologic drainage procedures. "
neoplasms,"Spontaneous infarction of placental chorioangioma and associated regression of hydrops fetalis. We report a case of a large chorioangioma diagnosed prenatally with concomitant meconium peritonitis and hydrops fetalis in the second trimester. Spontaneous regression of the tumor occurred, associated with some resolution of the fetal hydrops and delivery near term with good neonatal outcome. "
neoplasms,"Adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's esophagus. A review of nine adenocarcinomas of the esophagus arising in Barrett's epithelium was undertaken. We found the disease among white males disproportionately. Risk factors and incidence rate remain to be clarified. Only one patient was in a surveillance program and only he had carcinoma discovered ""early."" He still survives while only one of the eight whose diagnosis followed investigation of symptoms remains alive. "
neoplasms,Oral squamous cell carcinoma arising in a patient with long-standing lichen planus. A case report. The risk of malignant transformation of oral lichen planus remains a controversial point. Many previous reports have been discounted on the basis of inadequate information or lack of histologic confirmation of lichen planus. We report a well-documented case of long-standing cutaneous and oral lichen planus in which squamous cell carcinoma of the dorsal portion of the tongue occurred. There is an apparent difference in the sites of oral carcinomas in patients with lichen planus compared with the general population. This suggests that lichen planus increases the risk of oral cancer in affected sites. 
neoplasms,"The survivors of childhood solid tumors. With the improvement in cancer therapy in recent years, the number of cancer survivors is rapidly increasing. Potential late medical and psychosocial sequelae of cancer therapy are reviewed. A practical guide for the primary health care giver is provided. "
neoplasms,Left superior vena cava: a pitfall in computed tomographic diagnosis with surgical implications. We report 2 cases in which computed tomography of the mediastinum demonstrated an abnormality originally misinterpreted as lymphadenopathy but subsequently shown to represent a left superior vena cava. Misinterpretation may result in errors in optimum treatment and may complicate surgical exploration of the mediastinum. These 2 cases are presented to remind radiologists and surgeons of the possibility of this unusual anatomy. 
neoplasms,"Third ventricle cavernous angioma: report of two cases. Cavernous angioma arising in the third ventricle is an extremely rare disease. We have reviewed five cases previously reported, as well as our own two cases, and discuss the clinical characteristics of and surgical approach to cavernous angioma at this site. The bifrontal craniotomy and interhemispheric translamina terminalis approach minimize the damage to the brain and allow for an approach to the third ventricle in a wide operative field with minimal compression of the brain itself. We have found this approach to be suitable for surgery on angiomas of the anterior half of the third ventricle. "
neoplasms,"Hemoperitoneum as a result of coital injury without associated vaginal injury. Hemoperitoneum as a result of coital injury without associated vaginal injury is an extremely rare entity, and evidence by only five cases that have been reported in the medical literature to date. We report five additional cases encountered in two medical centers. Two of these were ruptured corpus luteum cysts, one was a laceration of the round ligament, another was a laceration of an ovary, and the fifth was rupture of a serous cystadenoma. This diagnosis should be considered in patients with hemoperitoneum after coitus. "
neoplasms,"Pelvic pain: lessons from anatomy and physiology. Pelvic pain is often a difficult differential diagnosis in the emergency department. For physiologic reasons, pain in the pelvis is difficult to localize to a specific organ, and pelvic peritonitis is hard to recognize. On the other hand, differences in types of pain can be very useful in arriving at a correct diagnosis. The clinician must learn to recognize superficial and deep somatic pain, and differentiate between various types of visceral pain which originate from inflammation, ischemia, or colic. A review of the anatomy and physiology of pelvic pain helps identify some of the problems as well as potential aids in approaching the patient with pelvic pain. "
neoplasms,"Visual disturbance in patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. Visual disturbance in 11 patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk was analyzed. Goldmann visual field examination showed enlargement of Mariotte's blind spot in 7 of 10 patients (70%) and visual field defect or depression in 7 patients (70%). In 6 of the 7 patients with visual field defect of depression (86%), the portion of visual field damage corresponded with the location of the tumor and retinal nerve fiber bundle defect. In 1 patient, sudden loss of visual acuity occurred, presumably due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy induced by melanocytoma. "
neoplasms,Increased expression of the multidrug-resistance gene in undifferentiated sarcoma. We analyzed multidrug-resistance gene (mdr1 gene) expression in a patient with undifferentiated sarcoma of the liver using the cloned cDNA for the mdr1 gene. Tissue samples were available at the time of initial diagnosis and of two intracranial relapses after chemotherapy with a regimen including doxorubicin and teniposide. The level of mdr1 gene expression was increased sevenfold in the intracranial tumor at the time of first relapse and 11-fold at the second relapse. This case may be an example of acquired multidrug resistance associated with overexpression of the mdr1 gene. 
neoplasms,"Primary de novo adenocarcinoma of the colon measuring 8 mm in diameter with lymph node metastases. Report of a case. Colonic adenocarcinomas measuring less than 10 mm are rare. Herein, we report a carcinoma measuring 8 mm in diameter associated with subserosal extension through a ""locus minoris resistentiae"" and metastases to lymph nodes, an association not previously reported. No residual adenomatous tissue was found, suggesting a de novo carcinoma. "
neoplasms,"New insights into the causes of cancer. Recent advances in molecular biologic analysis have led to major new insights concerning the genetic mechanisms underlying the development of cancer. This article examines the current state of our understanding of the genetic basis underlying the possible mechanisms of carcinogenesis and metastasis. The nature of the genetic lesions found in some cancer-causing genes, cancer-inhibiting genes, growth factor genes, and metastasis genes is discussed, as is the impact that these may have on clinical oncology. "
neoplasms,"Pedunculated giant lipoma of the esophagus. A patient with a giant lipoma of the esophagus presented with progressive dysphagia and odynophagia, fever, and recurrent melena. Two years previously, when the symptoms were less pronounced, it had been misdiagnosed as achalasia. After surgical removal of the lipoma, the patient became symptom free. "
neoplasms,"Cutaneous horn of the penis: its association with squamous cell carcinoma and HPV-16 infection. Cutaneous horns of the penis are rare. Including this case, only 19 cases have been reported in the English-language literature. In 37% of the reported cases a malignant tumor was found beneath the cutaneous horn. Our case is remarkable because a stage I squamous cell carcinoma developed on the shaft of the penis of a neonatally circumcised man. Human genital carcinoma resulting from a multifactorial process in which ""promoting"" papillomavirus is an integral element is being increasingly reported. We review the relationship of circumcision to genital human papillomavirus infection and their synergism in the development of squamous cell carcinoma. "
neoplasms,"Nonpigmented congenital iris stromal cyst. A nonpigmented iris stromal cyst was observed in the right eye of a 6-week-old girl. There was no past history of trauma or use of topical miotics, and the remainder of the ocular examination was normal. The pathophysiology and management of this rare developmental anomaly are controversial. "
neoplasms,"Pulmonary blastoma with malignant melanoma component. Pulmonary blastomas are rare primary tumors that consist of tubular or glandular structures embedded in an undifferentiated mesenchymal stroma. Focal cartilage, bone, and skeletal muscle as well as squamous differentiation have been described in these tumors. We report a unique case of a pulmonary blastoma showing a malignant melanoma component. Immunohistochemical stains for S100 protein and HMB-45 were positive in the areas of melanocytic differentiation. "
neoplasms,"Indications for the surgical treatment of osteomas of the frontal and ethmoid sinuses. Sixty-one patients with an osteoma of the frontal or ethmoid sinuses have been studied. The following indications for surgical removal of these osteomas are suggested: osteomas extending beyond the boundaries of the frontal sinus, if enlarging, if localized in the region adjacent to the nasofrontal duct, if signs of chronic sinusitis are present, osteomas of the ethmoid sinuses, irrespective of their size and if patients with osteomas complain of headache and other causes of headache have been excluded. The operation of choice is the osteoplastic flap operation. "
neoplasms,"Malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the conjunctiva. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of the conjunctiva is an extremely rare tumour, and only three previous cases have been reported. We describe two patients with MFH of the conjunctiva: a 58-year-old white male with epibulbar tumour who had exenteration and is alive after five years' follow-up, and a 3 1/2-year-old African girl with xeroderma pigmentosum and an MFH of her right eye conjunctiva, the first reported case of this association. The characteristics and the methods of diagnosis of MFH are discussed. "
neoplasms,Two distinct loci on the short arm of chromosome 16 are involved in myeloid leukemia. We report a case of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) M5 with the characteristic t(8;16)(p11;p13). The breakpoint in the short arm was regionally localized using nonradioactive in situ hybridization with a series of cosmids of chromosome 16. The results show that a difference exists between the breakpoint in chromosome 16(p13) in this t(8;16) and the breakpoint involved in the short arm in the characteristic inversion 16 (p13;q22)) that occurs in ANLL M4eo. Two different loci appear to be involved in these chromosomal rearrangements. 
neoplasms,"Stimulation of tumor cell growth by vasoactive intestinal peptide. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) stimulated the growth of murine Lewis lung carcinoma cells in culture. The growth promoting effect was dependent on the concentration of VIP. Exposure to VIP for 12 hours followed by removal of the peptide resulted in sustained growth promotion for 4 to 5 days in culture. Synthetic fragments of VIP, i.e., VIP (1-16) and VIP (22-28), and the unrelated peptide neurotensin failed to stimulate the growth of the Lewis lung carcinoma cells. The growth-promoting effect of VIP was also observed in a murine mammary tumor cell line and a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line. "
neoplasms,Locally recurrent endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the prostate after radical prostatectomy. Endometrioid carcinoma of the prostate is considered a variant of classical prostatic ductal carcinoma. Endometrioid carcinoma variant often has the unique clinical presentation of gross hematuria. The propensity of this tumor to spread within the urothelium makes local failure of curative therapy commonplace. We present 2 representative cases with a review of followup surveillance procedures and treatment options for the local recurrence once identified. 
neoplasms,"Chemotherapy-related hemolytic-uremic syndrome after the treatment of head and neck cancer. A case report. A 62-year-old woman who was being treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck developed a chemotherapy-related hemolytic-uremic syndrome during the second cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin, bleomycin, and methotrexate. Though the syndrome was suspected early, attempts at reversing the hematologic and renal abnormalities were unsuccessful. At postmortem examination, the characteristic microvascular lesions of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome were found in the kidneys. "
neoplasms,"Management of perineal wounds following abdominoperineal resection with inferior gluteal flaps. Our experience treating perineal wounds secondary to abdominoperineal resection, either for inflammatory bowel disease or cancer, is presented. A total of 16 patients were treated either on a delayed basis or at the same time as the abdominoperineal resection. All wounds were closed using the inferior gluteal myocutaneous flap. Fifteen of 16 patients have achieved healing, eight of whom had no complications. Only minor revisions or local wound care were required in the remaining patients, with only one patient failing to heal. Our results compare favorably with previous reports of treatment of this difficult problem. "
neoplasms,"Mammography and early breast cancer detection. Screening mammography has been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality. Both film-screen mammography and xeromammography are highly sensitive and specific. Mammography accreditation programs assure physicians and patients that a facility provides mammography of the highest quality, using the lowest possible radiation dose. Mammographic signs of early cancer include a small mass, calcifications, architectural distortion and a neodensity. Dense tissue may result in a false-negative examination even when a cancer is palpable, with adverse effects if biopsy is delayed. "
neoplasms,"Abnormal differentiation of human papillomavirus-induced laryngeal papillomas. We studied the proliferation and differentiation of human laryngeal papillomas, which are benign tumors induced by human papillomaviruses. Immunofluorescent stains of tissues for a number of differentiation-specific proteins showed abnormal differentiation. Papilloma tissue fragments in vitro showed a slightly decreased fraction of proliferating cells that incorporated tritiated thymidine and a markedly reduced incorporation of tritiated uridine when compared with normal tissue. We propose that papillomavirus infection results in normal basal cell proliferation but abnormal terminal differentiation and that this abnormality significantly contributes to the hyperplasia of the papillomas. "
neoplasms,Intralaryngotracheal thyroid. A case of intralaryngotracheal thyroid in a 57-year-old man is presented. The treatment modalities are considered and the previous literature is reviewed. 
neoplasms,"Management of soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. The management of soft tissue sarcomas has undergone and continues to undergo important changes. The purpose of this report is to review the presentation, diagnosis, and natural history of soft tissue sarcomas. In so doing, the importance of a careful and rigorous method of evaluation will be emphasized. Furthermore, the results of multidisciplinary treatment, with a goal towards limb salvage, will be reviewed. With appropriate and timely intervention, selected patients with pulmonary metastases may still experience long-term survival. Throughout this review, the importance of early and continuing multidisciplinary treatment and evaluation will be emphasized. "
neoplasms,"An adult with common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (C-ALL) presenting with skin infiltration. A 22-year-old man presented with multiple raised erythematous skin lesions, pyrexia and epistaxis. A diagnosis of common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (C-ALL) was made by morphological, cytochemical, immunological and cytogenetic examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow. Biopsy of the skin revealed leukaemic infiltration by similar cells. "
neoplasms,"Fungal brain abscesses (aspergillosis/mucormycosis) in two immunosuppressed patients. Although the mortality rate for fungal brain abscesses in immunosuppressed patients remains unacceptably high, this figure may be reduced if computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans are performed more promptly in susceptible individuals with seemingly mild intracranial complaints. Earlier presumptive amphotericin B treatment and more timely surgical debridement may minimize neurological injury and enhance survival. These assumptions were only tentatively supported by the clinical courses of two patients, one an alert patient with promyelocytic leukemia and an aspergillosis brain abscess who survived, and the other, a comatose intravenous drug abuser with mucormycosis who died. "
neoplasms,"Isolated calcaneal metastasis in a patient with endometrial adenocarcinoma. A 55-year-old woman with a history of Stage IA endometrial adenocarcinoma, previously treated with surgery and intracavitary radiation therapy, had an isolated calcaneal metastasis. Normal radiographs led to a delay in the diagnosis of her relapse. An ankle computed tomographic scan finally identified a mass, and the surgical biopsy specimen confirmed the diagnosis. This is the first reported case of an isolated calcaneal metastasis in endometrial adenocarcinoma to the authors' knowledge. "
neoplasms,"The Cancer Prevention Reminder System. The Cancer Prevention Reminder System is a computer-based system designed to increase the delivery of periodic health maintenance procedures. The program provides printed reminders that identify patients' overdue procedures, prints summary reports of the percentage of patients who are eligible and overdue for a procedure, and prints mailing labels for patients. We performed a randomized, controlled trial in which the effects of computer-based reminders were compared with those of two other interventions among residents in a university-based group practice. "
neoplasms,"Longitudinal study of women with negative cervical smears according to endocervical status A longitudinal study of 20,222 women who received negative cervical smear reports in 1987 showed that the incidence of definite or equivocal cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was not significantly different between those whose first smear lacked an endocervical component and those whose smear included an endocervical component. The incidence of definite cytological evidence of CIN was significantly lower in women whose first smear did not include an endocervical component. It is concluded that women whose smears are reported as negative but lack an endocervical component should not be rescreened any earlier than women with negative smears that include an endocervical component. "
neoplasms,"Anaplastic large cell (Ki-1) lymphoma with histiocytic phenotype simulating carcinoma. Histiocytic and epithelial cell types share many cytomorphologic and functional characteristics; it is predictable, therefore, that corresponding malignancies might be difficult to distinguish. Described is the case of a 52-year-old woman in whom disseminated anaplastic large-cell lymphoma simulated carcinomatosis by conventional morphologic criteria. Evidence of histiocytic differentiation was derived from immunocytochemical, fine structural, and genetic probe analyses. The diagnosis of histiocytic neoplasia is discussed in relation to categories previously termed malignant histiocytosis, ""Ki-1"" lymphoma, and regressing atypical histiocytosis, and comparisons are made with animal tumor models. "
neoplasms,"Using a state cancer registry to increase screening behaviors of sisters and daughters of breast cancer patients. The Pennsylvania Cancer Registry was used to contact breast cancer patients and, through them, their adult sisters and daughters. The sisters and daughters were counseled concerning their higher than average risks for breast cancer and their need for mammography and breast self-examination. Results showed a 9 percent increase in mammography and a 10 percent increase in breast self-examination rates for the counseled over control group. Costs were $49 per counseled sister or daughter indicating a need to increase cost effectiveness before implementation is practical. "
neoplasms,"Congenital midline nasal masses: diagnosis and management. Congenital midline nasal masses (CMNMs) are rare lesions most commonly caused by dermoids, hemangiomas, nasal gliomas or encephaloceles. We report a case of nasal glioma and discuss the embryologic development, evaluation, and management of such CMNMs. "
neoplasms,"Secretin provocation test in the diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The secretin stimulation test has become the preferred provocative test in suspected cases of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. A pure secretin preparation, a gastrin-specific radioimmunoassay, and an appropriate sampling sequence are important for the proper interpretation of this test. Gastric acid analysis is necessary in the assessment of hypergastrinemia to confirm acid hypersecretion and exclude achlorhydria. When properly performed and interpreted, the secretin provocation test offers a safe, expeditious, and reliable means of evaluating patients with hypergastrinemia. "
neoplasms,"Ras gene mutations in intraductal papillary neoplasms of the pancreas. Analysis in five cases. Five intraductal papillary neoplasms of the pancreas were analyzed for the presence of the Ras gene mutations. Three (60%) of the five neoplasms showed point mutations at K-ras codon 12. This incidence of the mutations was rather low compared with that found with ordinary pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The presence of the mutations did not correlate with the severity of cellular atypia, but was apparently related to the size of the tumor. The two neoplasms that had no mutations were smaller than the others that had mutations. The analysis suggested that Ras gene mutation is not the first genetic alteration of tumor progression, but that it occurs during the development of neoplasms of the pancreas. "
neoplasms,Cavernous hemangioma of the spinal cord: report of 2 unusual cases. We present 2 cases of spinal cord intramedullary cavernous hemangioma; 1 patient is the 1st reported case of multiple spinal cord lesions. Diagnosis is greatly enhanced by the use of MRI. 
neoplasms,"Leukocyte larceny: spurious hypoxemia confirmed with pulse oximetry Leukemic patients with extremely high white blood counts may exhibit the phenomenon of leukocyte larceny, in which white blood cells metabolize plasma oxygen in arterial blood gas samples (ABG) producing a spuriously low oxygen tension. We report the case of a leukemic patient with a white blood count in excess of 500,000 in whom multiple ABGs documented hypoxemia out of proportion to his clinical picture. Pulse oximetry was used to confirm higher hemoglobin oxygen saturation to establish the leukocyte larceny. "
neoplasms,Coexistence of testicular carcinoma and hairy cell leukemia. The coexistence of two relatively rare disorders in 1 patient often induces speculation about possible cause and effect of these disorders. The suitable therapeutic regimen for both diseases and roentgenologic manifestations are described. 
neoplasms,"Kaposi's sarcoma of the colon in a young HIV-negative woman with Crohn's disease. We report a case of isolated colonic Kaposi's sarcoma in a 36-year-old HIV-negative woman with refractory Crohn's disease of the colon and perineum following 11 months' treatment with azathioprine. The clinical features of this case are quite different from those classically described in Kaposi's sarcoma. Among the known risk factors, iatrogenic immunosuppression would appear to be the most probable. "
neoplasms,"Selenium. Nutritional, toxicologic, and clinical aspects Despite the recent findings of environmental contamination, selenium toxicosis in humans is exceedingly rare in the United States, with the few known cases resulting from industrial accidents and an episode involving the ingestion of superpotent selenium supplements. Chronic selenosis is essentially unheard of in this country because of the typical diversity of the American diet. Nonetheless, because of the growing public interest in selenium as a dietary supplement and the occurrence of environmental selenium contamination, medical practitioners should be familiar with the nutritional, toxicologic, and clinical aspects of this trace element. "
neoplasms,Massive metastasis from squamous carcinoma of the tonsil. Squamous carcinomas of the oro-pharynx are associated with a high incidence of distant metastases at post-mortem. A case of a massive distant metastasis from a squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil is presented. This occurred despite excellent local control. The pathology and the possible management implications are discussed. 
neoplasms,"Familial hypobetalipoproteinaemia complicated by cerebellar ataxia and steatocystoma multiplex. A 55-year-old man with cerebellar ataxia and steatocystoma multiplex was found to have reduced serum concentrations of total cholesterol, betalipoprotein and apolipoprotein B. Computed tomography revealed atrophy of the cerebellum and brain stem. Of the six family members examined, four had hypobetalipoproteinaemia, and one had mild ataxia. Similar skin lesions were noted in five male relatives. This case represents a rare combination of familial hypobetalipoproteinaemia, cerebellar ataxia and steatocystoma multiplex. "
neoplasms,Metastatic carcinoma to the retina. Clinicopathologic findings in two cases. Two cases of metastatic carcinoma to the neuroretina are reported. One patient had an oat cell carcinoma of the lung that was metastatic to the brain and retina; this was confirmed postmortem. The other patient had metastatic breast carcinoma with seeding of tumor cells into the vitreous from a focus of retinal embolism. The diagnosis was confirmed from a vitrectomy specimen. 
neoplasms,"Atrial fibrillation with cardiac tamponade as the initial manifestation of malignant pericarditis This article describes the case of a 72-year-old woman with cardiac tamponade and atrial fibrillation as the initial manifestation of a lymphoid malignancy. The pathogenesis of cardiac tamponade, various diagnostic modalities, and therapy of this condition are reviewed. "
neoplasms,"Acquired von Willebrand's syndrome. Therapeutic and diagnostic implications. Acquired von Willebrand's syndrome is a newly recognized bleeding diathesis thought to be caused by autoantibodies to the von Willebrand factor. Acquired von Willebrand's syndrome has been reported in association with lymphoproliferative disorders and benign monoclonal gammopathies. Clinical features and laboratory abnormalities of this disease are similar to congenital von Willebrand's disease, but the optimal treatment may differ. We describe a 75-year-old man with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and recurrent epistaxis and also discuss the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of both the congenital and acquired disorders. "
neoplasms,Intracerebral solitary plasmacytoma. We report a rare occurrence of intraparenchymal plasmacytoma and review the literature. The clonal nature of the neoplasm is demonstrated by immunohistochemical and molecular techniques. The importance of the latter techniques in ruling out other pathological entities is stressed. 
neoplasms,"Auro-nasopharyngeal polyp and cholesteatoma. We report the association of an auronasopharyngeal polyp arising in a congenitally abnormal middle ear and Eustachian tube. Subsequently, ten years after removal of the polyp and insertion of a ventilation tube, there was recurrence of the polyp in association with cholesteatoma of the middle ear. "
neoplasms,Metastatic ciliary body carcinoid tumor. A 50-year-old man with a history of systemic carcinoid had decreased right eye vision and a darkly pigmented cilio-choroidal mass. Results of ultrasonographic and fluorescein angiographic examinations were consistent with a malignant melanoma. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the lesion identified it as a carcinoid metastasis. The patient refused both radiation and enucleation; complete excision with a cyclochoroidectomy was performed. Histopathologic examination showed a carcinoid neoplasm covered by marked hyperplasia of the retinal pigment epithelium that produced the pigmented appearance of the lesion. 
neoplasms,"Laryngeal myxoma. Myxoma is a rare mesenchymal tumor that is especially uncommon in the head and neck. We report a case of a myxoma of the larynx in a 70-year-old man, which, to our knowledge, is the second case reported in the English-language literature. Although benign, myxomas have a propensity for local recurrence due to their tendency to infiltrate surrounding tissues. They commonly appear encapsulated, but simple enucleation is not adequate treatment; excision should include a margin of normal tissue around the tumor. "
neoplasms,"Meningiomas mimicking cerebral schwannoma. A brain tumor with histological features reminiscent of schwannoma with underlying meningioangiomatosis was subjected to electron microscopic and immunohistochemical analysis, which confirmed the neoplasm as a meningioma. This prompted reexamination of a similar tumor, described in a previous publication as a cerebral schwannoma, with identical immunohistochemical techniques. The results obtained favored alteration of this diagnosis to that of meningioma. This experience has led the authors to recommend the use of immunohistochemistry techniques when evaluating unusual intracranial neoplasms. "
neoplasms,Common nonvenereal genital lesions. There are a wide variety of local and systemic skin diseases that produce lesions in the genitoanal region. These lesions may resemble those produced by sexually transmitted microorganisms. The purpose of this article is to make physicians aware of the common skin diseases that produce lesions on the genitalia to avoid the inappropriate diagnosis of a sexually transmitted disease. 
neoplasms,Rhinosporidiosis associated with squamous cell carcinoma in the tongue. The peritumoural region of a squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue when examined with light and electron microscope showed nodular bodies in the submucosa with all the distinctive features of 'sporangium and 'spores' of rhinosporidiosis. The occurrence of rhinosporidiosis in the tongue along with malignancy has not been reported hitherto. Some interesting observations and causal relationships are discussed. 
neoplasms,"A report on radiation-induced gliomas. Radiation-induced gliomas are uncommon, with only 73 cases on record to date. The disease that most frequently occasioned radiation therapy has been acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Three more cases are added here, two after irradiation for ALL and one after irradiation for tinea capitis. In a review of the relevant literature, the authors stress the possibility that the ALL-glioma and the retinoblastoma-glioma links point to syndromes in their own right that may occur without radiation therapy. "
neoplasms,"Mandibular involvement in oral cancer. It is difficult to predict the tumour invasion into the mandible by oral cancer pre-operatively, and consequently the decision to preserve or sacrifice the mandible is largely individualistic. The present study of 44 cases analyses the reliability of pre-operative parameters to assess mandibular involvement. Clinical, radiological and scintigraphic features have been compared with the detailed histology of the bone. This study confirms the usefulness of superior marginal resections in lesions which are close to but not involving the mandible, as well as for superficial lesions which are actually seen to involve the mandible but their CT and bone scans are negative for tumour invasion. "
neoplasms,"The history of nitrite in human nutrition: a contribution from German cookery books. In order to settle the question of when saltpetre (nitrate) came in use as an additive to human food, a number of historic cookery books from Germany and Austria were reviewed. Obviously, the change from vegetable dyes to saltpetre for the coloring or color preservation, respectively, of meat occurred between 1600 and 1750, probably near 1700. The addition of sugar which favours the reduction of nitrate to the active agent nitrite became common practice during the 19th century. Thus some historic parallels to the appearance of colorectal cancer, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis in the medical literature became apparent. "
neoplasms,"Cutaneous surgery and the pregnant patient. Cutaneous surgery in 34 pregnant women is described. The main indication for surgery was the diagnosis and/or treatment of malignancy. Surgery during the period of organogenesis (15 to 56 days) should be avoided when possible. Patients should be positioned on the left side during the procedure to avoid the supine hypotensive syndrome. Monitoring of the fetal heartbeat is desirable. Local anesthetics, penicillin, and erythromycin are safe if used carefully. Acetaminophen is the analgesic of choice. Exposure to the sun should be avoided during the perioperative period. "
neoplasms,Malignant adenolymphoma of the parotid gland: report of carcinomatous transformation. Malignant transformation of an adenolymphoma (Warthin's tumour) is a rare event. This paper presents a case of carcinoma arising in an adenolymphoma of the parotid gland. 
neoplasms,Lymphoscintigraphy with 123I-labelled epidermal growth factor We have used 123I-labelled epidermal growth factor (EGF) scans to study 14 patients with advanced cervical cancer. Abnormal lymph node imaging was seen most clearly 6-8 h after the injection and revealed abnormal uptake by pelvic lymph nodes in 11 patients. 4 of these 11 had abnormal computerised tomographic and ultrasound scans; in the other 7 conventional radiology did not confirm the presence of disease. 
neoplasms,"Razor-blade surgery. The razor blade can be a valuable tool in the performance of many minor surgical procedures. It is extremely sharp, flexible, inexpensive, readily available, and easy to use. The technique and specific applications are reviewed and discussed. "
neoplasms,"Intraventricular diamorphine via an Ommaya shunt for intractable cancer pain. We describe two patients in whom diamorphine was administered into the intraventricular space via an Ommaya reservoir, producing excellent pain relief. The use of this technique for long term administration of analgesia is reviewed. "
neoplasms,"Nasal midline masses in infants and children. Dermoids, encephaloceles, and gliomas. Nasal dermoids, gliomas, and encephaloceles are uncommon congenital lesions that result from aberrant embryologic development. We have treated 46 children with these nasal lesions. In view of the potential intracranial connection, patients are at risk for intracranial infection, and early surgical correction is thus imperative. Neuroimaging studies may help to predict intracranial involvement. "
neoplasms,"Intraluminal crystalloids in struma ovarii. Immunohistochemical, DNA flow cytometric, and ultrastructural study. We recently encountered a unique case of follicular variant of papillary carcinoma arising in struma ovarii that contained numerous intrafollicular crystalloids. There was no evidence of capsular or vascular invasion or metastases, though the DNA content of the papillary carcinoma was aneuploid. In contrast, diploid DNA was manifested in the histologically benign thyroid tissue. The nature of the crystalloids and the significance of aneuploid DNA content are discussed. "
neoplasms,"Pedunculated soft-tissue mass on the alveolar gingiva [clinical conference] A case of peripheral ameloblastoma, a rare intraoral neoplasm, has been presented. The lesion appears most commonly as a mass on the mandibular lingual gingiva of patients in their fifth and sixth decades of life. The peripheral ameloblastoma does not share the aggressive nature of the intraosseous variant. The lesion has been overtreated in the past and warrants only a local supraperiosteal excision. "
neoplasms,"Immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma presenting as an eyelid tumor. A 59-year-old white man presented with an ulcerating mass of the left upper eyelid of 6 months' duration. A biopsy specimen of the tumor was diagnosed as an immunoblastic T-cell malignant lymphoma. The lesion completely regressed after 4000 cGy of cobalt-60 radiation therapy. In the ensuing 33 months, multiple, widespread skin nodules of the same neoplasm developed including a right upper eyelid tumor. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of an immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma initially manifesting as an eyelid neoplasm. "
neoplasms,"The prognostic significance of CA 125 half-life in patients with ovarian cancer who have received primary chemotherapy after surgical cytoreduction. Fifty-four patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer were monitored with serial serum CA 125 levels after surgical cytoreduction and during multi-agent chemotherapy with cisplatin-containing regimens. CA 125 half-life of less than 20 days was associated with prolonged overall survival (p less than 0.015). In those patients who eventually were found to be disease-free at surgical surveillance procedures, normalization of serum CA 125 levels to less than 35 U/ml within 65 days of primary operation also suggested an improved survival (p less than 0.059). "
neoplasms,Bladder perforation resulting from the use of the neodymium:YAG laser. Complications resulting from the use of the neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser to treat superficial bladder cancer are uncommon and are usually associated with abnormally high laser power outputs. We report a case of bladder perforation in a human attributed to the Nd:YAG laser used at a low power setting and comment on those factors that contributed to this complication. 
neoplasms,"Mucous cell hyperplasia in an odontogenic cyst from a patient with Muir-Torre syndrome. Mucous cell proliferation in a periapical radicular cyst from a patient with a family history of colonic malignancies and multiple sebaceous neoplasms of the skin, so-called Muir-Torre syndrome, is reported. Such goblet cell hyperplasia has not been previously reported to be associated with any known syndrome. We believe the finding of mucous cell hyperplasia in an odontogenic cyst may not simply be coincidental, but should raise suspicion of paraneoplastic potential and warrant further evaluation for possible occult neoplastic disease. "
neoplasms,"Performing cytogenetic studies on ascitic, amniotic and hygroma fluid. The importance of obtaining cytogenetic studies on antenatally diagnosed structural malformations is well recognized. In two cases, three fetal compartments were sampled, each resulting in successful cytogenetic studies. Fluid was obtained under ultrasound guidance from amniotic fluid, fetal ascites and cystic hygroma fluid. Fluid from the hygroma itself may be the easiest compartment to analyze. "
neoplasms,"Choroid plexus cysts and chromosomal defects During a 4-year period, 83 pregnant women with fetal choroid plexus cysts were investigated in our unit. Abnormal karyotypes were found in 20 fetuses, including trisomy 18 (n = 16), trisomy 13 (n = 1), triploidy (n = 1) and translocation Down's syndrome (n = 2). All fetuses with chromosomal defects had structural malformations in addition to the choroid plexus cysts. "
neoplasms,"Osteoid osteoma of the scapula. A case report and review of the literature. The scapula is a rare location for osteoid osteoma, which in most cases does not involve the flat bones. The en bloc excision in this uncommon location can be problematic since the surgical exposure is difficult, and shoulder joint function can be affected if the lesion is subchondral. In an 18-year-old man, an osteoid osteoma was located in the subchondral area of the glenoid. A guided needle biopsy of the nidus resulted in complete healing. This mode of treatment, with proper follow-up examination, is acceptable for a benign lesion situated in a problematic location. "
neoplasms,Necrolytic migratory erythema: association with neuroendocrine tumour with predominant insulin secretion. We report a case of necrolytic migratory erythema in association with a neuroendocrine tumour producing predominantly insulin. As far as we know this has not been observed before. 
neoplasms,"Pheochromocytoma with electrocardiographic change mimicking angina pectoris, and cyclic change in direct arterial pressure--a case report. A forty-two-year-old man was admitted because of chest pain. Electrocardiograms at admission showed horizontal ST depression in leads, II, III, aVF, V4, V5, and V6. Direct blood pressure monitoring revealed cyclic change between 160/100 mmHg and 70/50 mmHg and heart rate between 80/sec and 120/sec at fifteen minute intervals. The plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations were elevated during the episodes of hypertension. Pheochromocytoma was found in the right adrenal gland. These cyclic changes in blood pressure and heart rate are an aid for diagnosis. "
neoplasms,"Chondrosarcoma complicating total hip arthroplasty in Maffucci's syndrome. A 70-year-old woman who was followed for 60 years for Maffucci's syndrome required a total hip arthroplasty (THA) of the right hip for degenerative arthritis. This did not relieve pain. Three years later, chondrosarcoma of the femur developed around the femoral component and was fatal. The roentgenographic changes after the THA were incorrectly interpreted as being caused by infection. "
neoplasms,"Insulinoma after streptozotocin therapy for metastatic gastrinoma: natural history or iatrogenic complication? Islet cell carcinoma frequently produces more than one chemical product, although its clinical expression is usually restricted to a single hormone. We describe an unusual patient who presented with full-blown metastasizing gastrinoma. He was treated with cimetidine for five years and then streptozotocin therapy, which resulted in a regression in hepatomegaly and a fall in serum gastrin levels. Following one year's therapy with streptozotocin, he was admitted in hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic stupor. This appears to be the first reported case of a ""shift"" from clinical gastrinoma to insulinoma possibly related to prolonged streptozotocin therapy. "
neoplasms,"Malignant melanoma presenting as nasal obstruction. Mucosal melanomas arising in the nasal cavity are rare tumors comprising less than 1 percent of all melanomas. Often, the common clinical symptom is nasal obstruction. Grossly, they may or may not be pigmented and frequently attain large sizes. Histologic diagnosis of these tumors may be difficult, requiring immunohistochemical or electron microscopic confirmation. Aggressive surgical management is the treatment of choice in clinical stage I disease. Subsequent surveillance for recurrence is mandatory. Markers such as 5-S-cysteinyldopa may prove useful in staging, prognosticating, and postoperative surveillance for early recurrence, but their exact role has yet to be delineated. Ultimate prognosis is poor. "
neoplasms,"Heffalumps, jagulars, and cheshire cats. A commentary on cytokeratins and soft tissue sarcomas. Historically, antibodies to cytokeratin intermediate filaments have been models of target specificity. In most diagnostic settings, the utility of these antibodies was unquestioned; reactivity for cytokeratin was dogmatically equated with epithelial differentiation. Recently, however, the diagnostic importance of these antibodies has been challenged, prompted by the demonstration of cytokeratin reactivity in a variety of ""nonepithelial"" neoplasms. In this review, the evolving literature on this topic is explored, and the practical implications of these findings are discussed. "
neoplasms,"Liver abscess complicating intratumoral ethanol injection therapy for HCC. We report a patient who developed multiple liver abscesses and sepsis caused by lactobacilli after the percutaneous intratumoral injection of ethanol for hepatocellular carcinoma. We diagnosed the liver abscess at an early stage because of a the finding of gas on ultrasound and computed tomography. Blood cultures grew Gram-positive rods, which were of the Lactobacillus species. The patient responded to the administration of antibiotics, and his hepatic tumors have not recurred in the 7 months since treatment. This is the first report of liver abscess following percutaneous ethanol injection therapy. "
neoplasms,"Histopathologic grading of salivary gland neoplasms: II. Acinic cell carcinomas. Acinic cell carcinomas display varied cytoarchitectural patterns of growth that should allow for formulation of histopathologic grading. Grading of these carcinomas may serve to identify subsets whose biologic behavior is more aggressive than the usually accepted low-grade behavior of acinic cell carcinomas as a group. To that end, a three-level histopathologic grading scheme is presented. "
neoplasms,"Polycystic ovary syndrome and bulimia. One hundred fifty-three patients classified as suffering from polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and 109 patients who were suffering from a clear organic disorder or endocrinopathy received the bulimia investigation test (Edinburgh) (BITE) questionnaire for abnormal eating behaviors. Patients with PCOS showed a significant increase in their mean BITE score for approximately a third had abnormal eating patterns, and 6% have scores suggestive of clinical bulimia compared with only 1% of women in the group with organic endocrinopathies. The work suggests that women with PCOS should be screened for abnormal eating behaviors and raises the possibility that treatment by psychological means should be considered when abnormal eating behaviors are present. "
neoplasms,"Nevus flammeus. Discordance in monozygotic twins. Nevus flammeus has been described as an inherited vascular anomaly. We report two cases of nevus flammeus, each appearing in one of two monozygotic twins. This finding supports the idea that nevus flammeus results from embryologic mishap rather than genetic transmission. "
neoplasms,"Papillary adenocarcinoma of the middle ear. A case of papillary adenocarcinoma of the middle ear is presented. The patient had an unusually short history of otalgia, aural discharge and facial palsy, and, at presentation the tumour was too large for surgical resection to be a feasible option. The management of this rare tumour is discussed and the relevant literature reviewed. "
neoplasms,"Neoadjuvant Cis-DDP in esophageal cancers: an experience at a regional cancer centre, India. We are analysing the results of 80 patients who underwent surgery during 1983-84 for esophageal cancer. Forty patients who received pre-operative single agent Cis-DDP were grouped under ""A"" and 40 patients who went for surgery directly were grouped under ""B"". Twenty-two patients (55%) of Group A showed tumor necrosis. Both groups underwent resection and hand-sewn anastamosis of the esophagus. There were 10 post-operative deaths among 80 resected cases, 9 of them being from anastomatic leak. Cis-DDP has induced negligible side effects. A comparatively high survival rate during early years in patients who responded to Cis-DDP suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy might be of value. "
neoplasms,"Topical calcipotriol treatment in advanced breast cancer [published erratum appears in Lancet 1991 Jun 29;337(8757):1618] 19 patients with locally advanced or cutaneous metastatic breast cancer were treated with the topical vitamin D analogue calcipotriol 100 micrograms daily. 14 patients completed 6 weeks' treatment; 3 showed a 50% reduction in the bidimensional diameter of treated lesions and 1 other patient showed a minimal response. 2 patients became hypercalcaemic during treatment. In all patients who responded the tumours contained receptors for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, shown by immunocytochemistry. "
neoplasms,"Primary neoplasms of the central nervous system in children. Modern diagnostic imaging techniques are able to detect primary neoplasms of the central nervous system (CNS) in children safely and accurately but with less specificity as to cell type or degree of malignancy. These neoplasms, often peculiar in cell type and size, mediated by hydrocephalus in their clinical presentation, demand careful and often extensive imaging techniques best to evaluate their geography and character. Added to these basic observations, determination of the neoplasm from surrounding edema, detection of possible spread, and evaluation of residual or recurrent neoplasm are prime responsibilities of the pediatric neuroradiologist toward the child, neurosurgeon, and oncologist. "
neoplasms,Magnetic resonance imaging of vertebral osteoblastoma: a report of two cases. Two patients with vertebral osteoblastoma evaluated with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are presented. A literature review revealed that cases of osteoblastoma originating within the vertebral body are exceedingly rare. 
neoplasms,"Improved silver staining of nucleolar organiser regions in paraffin wax sections using an inverted incubation technique [published erratum appears in J Clin Pathol 1991 Jun;44(6):528] A new simple modification to the silver staining of nucleolar organiser regions (AgNORs) was devised which, by performing the incubation with the slide inverted, results in minimal undesirable background staining, a persistent problem. Inverted incubation is facilitated by the use of a commercially available plastic coverplate. This technique has several additional advantages over other published staining protocols. In particular, the method is straightforward, fast, and maintains a high degree of contrast between the background and the AgNORs. "
neoplasms,"The prophylactic use of octreotide in a patient with ovarian carcinoid and valvular heart disease. This case report describes the use of octreotide, a long-acting somatostatin analogue, in the management of a patient with an ovarian carcinoid tumour and severe cardiac valvular disease. This patient underwent laparotomy and tumour resection without complication. Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam, fentanyl, and vecuronium, and maintained with isoflurane as well as additional fentanyl and vecuronium. However, we feel that it was the use of octreotide that prevented a life-threatening crisis intraoperatively, and recommend its use in patients with carcinoid syndrome undergoing anaesthesia and surgery. "
neoplasms,"Malignant mixed tumor (malignant ameloblastoma and fibrosarcoma) of the maxilla. We present a rare case of carcinosarcoma (malignant ameloblastoma and fibrosarcoma) of the left maxilla that developed in a 63-year-old Japanese man. The tumor recurred repeatedly despite multiple surgical removals, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy and led to progressive cachexia; the patient died after 3.8 years of hospitalization. Histopathologic examination revealed that the recurrent tumor was carcinosarcoma, which had progressed from malignant ameloblastoma with fibroma. An autopsy confirmed the diagnosis of malignant mixed tumor with lung metastasis of malignant ameloblastoma and fibrosarcoma. "
neoplasms,"Extramammary Paget's disease of the bronchial epithelium. We report the first case, to our knowledge, of extramammary Paget's disease of the bronchial epithelium. The tumor displayed Paget's cells scattered within the bronchial epithelium in most of the lesion, but infiltrating into the bronchial submucosa and pulmonary parenchyma with microglandular and papillary patterns in some area. In addition to the histologic findings of coexistence with adenocarcinomatous components, in situ involvement into bronchial glands and ducts by Paget's cells was observed, suggesting that extramammary Paget's disease of the bronchial epithelium may be a variant of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, which is associated with bronchial glands. "
neoplasms,"Ruptured mature cystic teratoma of the ovary with recurrence in the liver and colon 17 years later. A case report. A mature cystic teratoma of the ovary occurred in a 51-year-old woman and recurred as a large intrahepatic tumor mass as well as a small mass in the transverse colon 17 years after rupture, intraperitoneal spillage of tumor contents and subtotal surgical removal of the ovarian lesion and peritoneal implants. The patient was treated with a partial hepatectomy and a segmental transverse colectomy. The recurrent lesions, which contained histologically fully mature teratomatous elements only, were excised; the result was a complete cure. To our knowledge this is the first documented report on such a complication of mature cystic teratoma of the ovary. "
neoplasms,"Proliferative mass found in the gingiva. The clinical course of peripheral ossifying fibroma is slow and the growth of most lesions is limited in size, usually up to 1.5 cm. Complaints are rare unless the surface becomes ulcerated, or the lesion compromises oral function or esthetic appearance. Treatment is surgical excision with close postoperative follow-up. Tooth extraction is seldom necessary. Proper surgical intervention, which includes excision of reactive tissue down to periosteum, affords a low recurrence rate of 14% to 16%. "
neoplasms,"Contributions of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The salient contributions of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome have made it unique. No pancreatic endocrine tumor described before (insulinoma) or subsequently (glucagonoma, somatostatinoma, vipoma, pancreatic-polypeptidoma) has been the topic of such a variety of studies, or has been such an inspiration and rich source of new ideas for investigation and ultimate improvement in patient care. "
neoplasms,"Stomatococcus mucilaginosus catheter-related infection in an adolescent with osteosarcoma. Ours is apparently the first reported pediatric case of Stomatococcus mucilaginosus bacteremia. It is the second reported case of S mucilaginosus catheter-associated infection, but the first case successfully treated without removing the central venous catheter. This unusual organism should be added to the list of opportunistic pathogens that can be isolated from immunocompromised pediatric patients. "
neoplasms,Severe lidocaine intoxication by cutaneous absorption. A severe lidocaine intoxication by cutaneous absorption is described. Data are presented to show a significant absorption of lidocaine through diseased skin when lidocaine cream is used as a local anesthetic. Awareness of this route of intoxication might be important in patients in whom neurologic or psychiatric symptoms develop while large amounts of lidocaine cream are being used. 
neoplasms,"Trabecular or Merkel's cell carcinoma. Two cases of trabecular cell carcinoma of the skin are presented. The clinical presentation and behavior, and the histologic findings, of the tumor are described. Surgical excision of the primary lesion with regional lymph node dissection, if indicated, is the treatment of choice. Distant metastasis is treated by local irradiation. "
neoplasms,"Two cases of adult T-cell leukemia associated with acute pancreatitis due to hypercalcemia. We report two cases of adult T-cell leukemia associated with acute pancreatitis and hypercalcemia. After sudden onset of epigastralgia, acute pancreatitis and hypercalcemia were found in both patients. There were no diseases that could explain the acute pancreatitis except for hypercalcemia probably due to adult T-cell leukemia. Thus we considered that hypercalcemia due to adult T-cell leukemia had led to acute pancreatitis. This is the first report of such a complication in adult T-cell leukemia. "
neoplasms,"Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome with oral hemangiomas. A case of blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome with oral hemangiomas is reported. Attention is directed to this syndrome because, although rare, it is usually associated with oral lesions. The blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome should always be considered a possibility in patients with oral hemangiomas and bluish skin nodules. "
neoplasms,"An unusual complication of silastic dural substitute: case report. A case is presented in which a patient developed an unusual complication after the use of Silastic dural substitute. In 1983, the patient underwent removal of a meningioma with the involved dura. Five years later, he developed around the graft material a very thick connective tissue capsule, which simulated a recurrent meningioma clinically and radiologically. "
neoplasms,"Neuromesenchymal hamartoma of the small bowel. We present the case of a long small bowel stricture with pathological features similar to those described as ""neuromuscular and vascular hamartoma,"" showing in addition extensive fatty submucosal infiltration and fibrous intramural nodules. In the controversy about the nature of this disorder, we consider it a separate entity. Taking into account that other mesenchymal tissues than the originally described can participate, we propose the alternative term of ""neuromesenchymal hamartoma"" of the small bowel. "
neoplasms,"New active analogues of vitamin D with low calcemic activity. In conclusion, a number vitamin D analogues have been developed that have very low calcemic activity but retain several other properties of 1,25-(OH)2D3, including the ability to differentiate leukemia and skin cells, to enhance the immune response, and to suppress parathyroid hormone levels. Although the mechanism of this selective activity is not yet clear, these analogues may provide new insights into the differences in action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in various target tissues. Most importantly, the selective action of these analogues may be exploited for the treatment of diseases such as leukemia, psoriasis and hyperparathyroidism. "
neoplasms,"Lipomatous hamartoma of the orbit. Proliferations of mature adipose tissue, while common in retroperitoneal and subcutaneous sites, rarely occur in the orbit. We describe the clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic findings of a nonencapsulated lipomatous tissue overgrowth of the right orbit in a 35-year-old man. The mass had caused proptosis since childhood and was apparently present since birth. Due to the age at onset, the histologic similarity to normal orbital fat, and the lack of encapsulation or choristomatous elements, we propose the term lipomatous hamartoma for this entity. "
neoplasms,"Osteosarcoma of the spermatic cord. Malignant tumors of the spermatic cord are rare but the vast majority of these tumors are sarcomas. We report on a patient with osteosarcoma arising in the spermatic cord. Left radical orchiectomy with high dissection of the spermatic cord was performed, and the patient remains free of recurrence 2 years postoperatively. We could find no previous discussion or report of this tumor. "
neoplasms,Coexisting thymic carcinoid tumor and thymoma. Thymic carcinoid tumors are unusual neoplasms that are different from thymomas. We report a case of coexisting thymic carcinoid tumor and thymoma associated with myasthenia gravis. The clinicopathological findings are discussed with a review of the literature. 
neoplasms,"Adrenal insufficiency in the cancer patient: implications for the surgeon. Aspects of acute and chronic adrenal insufficiency of interest to surgeons who treat cancer patients are reviewed. Clinical features and the management of both primary and secondary types are considered with reference to classification, aetiology, diagnosis and treatment. Specifically considered are the management of patients with Addison's disease and metastases. Prompt recognition and treatment of adrenal insufficiency can avert potentially life-threatening situations. "
neoplasms,"The management of pseudomyxoma peritonei. The management of nine patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei was reviewed. Aggressive surgical resection of tumor is the standard of treatment, with many patients requiring multiple laparotomies. Chemotherapy, including the use of cisplatin is not effective. Long-term nutritional support provides a better quality of survival for select patients. "
neoplasms,"131I treatment of thyroid papillary carcinoma in a patient with renal failure. Procedures for 131I ablation in renal failure are not known. In one patient receiving dialysis, detailed dosimetry and health safety aspects were obtained. The results showed insignificant contamination of equipment, but a surprisingly significant reduction in biologic half-life of 131I due to efficient dialysis extraction. The data indicate that 131I ablation can be done safely and easily during dialysis but that much higher 131I doses must be used to achieve equivalent results to those obtained in patients with normal renal function. "
neoplasms,"An unusual manifestation of Paget's disease of bone: spinal epidural hematoma presenting as acute cauda equina syndrome. Neurologic sequelae of Paget's disease of bone include involvement of the spinal cord or cauda equina due to mechanical compression by enlarged vertebrae, ischemia caused by a spinal artery, steal syndrome or neoplasm. We describe a patient with Paget's disease of bone who presented with acute cauda equina syndrome due to a spinal epidural hematoma. Clinicians need to recognize this entity since surgical intervention may result in a favorable outcome. "
neoplasms,"Extramedullary hematopoiesis in a bronchial carcinoid tumor. An unusual complication of agnogenic myeloid metaplasia. A case of bronchial carcinoid tumor with foci of extramedullary hematopoiesis is presented. The patient had a 6-year history of agnogenic myeloid metaplasia and hepatosplenomegaly. All three hematopoietic cell lines were represented in different areas of the bronchial tumor. To our knowledge, this is the first case of extramedullary hematopoiesis described in a bronchial carcinoid and only the fourth report of hematopoietic cells in a neoplasm of otherwise unrelated origin. The pathogenesis of this uncommon finding is discussed and the literature is reviewed. "
neoplasms,"Herpes zoster ophthalmicus and iris cysts. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus has been associated with numerous complications such as neuropathy, keratitis, anterior uveitis, and neuralgia. To my knowledge, there have been no reports of secondary iris cyst formation. I hereby report the case of a patient who developed an iris cyst during a Herpes zoster ophthalmicus infection. "
neoplasms,"Cecal diverticulitis presented as a cecal tumor. Seven patients diagnosed as having acute appendicitis were operated on and a cecal wall mass due to cecal diverticulitis was found. In two patients the mass could not be separated from the cecal wall and right colectomy was performed. In five patients, in whom the mass could be separated from the cecum, conservative operations (three diverticulectomies and two wedge resections) were performed, thus avoiding needless, more extensive surgery. "
neoplasms,"Haemangiopericytoma of the temporal bone. Haemangiopericytoma is an uncommon vascular tumour with a widespread distribution. Although meningeal involvement is well recognized, only a few sporadic cases of temporal bone lesions have been documented, all with doubtful sites of origin. Late presentation together with the restrictive anatomy of this region often precludes its effective removal and even minimal residual disease may progress rapidly. A series of three such patients are presented in order to discuss the natural history, histological features and treatment of this disease. "
neoplasms,"Inverted papilloma of renal pelvis: flexible ureteroscopic diagnosis and treatment. A case is reported of inverted papilloma of the renal pelvis in a patient with previous transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. The renal pelvic lesion was diagnosed and treated with a flexible ureteropyeloscope. Although nephroureterectomy was avoided, the patient must be carefully followed endoscopically and radiographically for recurrence of lesions throughout the urinary tract. This case represents the first report of the endoscopic diagnosis and treatment of an inverted papilloma of the renal pelvis. It demonstrates the vast potential for endoscopic diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance throughout the urinary tract. "
neoplasms,"A case of multiple pilar tumors and pilar cysts involving the scalp and back. The case of a patient with multiple proliferating trichilemmal tumors and trichilemmal cysts of the scalp and back is discussed. The multicentric presentation of this tumor is unusual and, to our knowledge, has not been described previously. The appearance of trichilemmal cysts in association with multiple proliferating trichilemmal tumors suggests a common histogenesis of these two neoplasms. The typical presenting features, histologic description, and recommended treatment for these tumors are reviewed. "
neoplasms,"Pathologic characteristics of human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-related extranodal orofacial lymphomas. Eleven cases of extranodal orofacial lymphomas (EOFL), consisting of four HTLV-related and seven HTLV-unrelated EOFL, were investigated with respect to the immunohistochemical and clinical features. HTLV-related EOFL were of T-cell phenotype and were associated with a poorer prognosis than HTLV-unrelated EOFL, most of which were of B-cell origin. The appearance of giant cells with cerebriform nuclei was helpful in identifying HTLV-related EOFL. The relatively high incidence of T-cell type EOFL in our series was considered to be related to the high percentage of HTLV carriers in our district, an area endemic for adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma.

neoplasms,"The use of molecular probes to distinguish new primary tumors from recurrent tumors in gynecologic malignancies. This is the first report using DNA molecular probe technology to distinguish between recurrent tumor and a second primary malignancy in a patient. Tumor DNA was extracted from squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix at the time of radical hysterectomy. Eighteen months later a squamous cell cancer was found in a vaginal apex biopsy from which DNA was extracted. Tumor DNA from both lesions was subjected to restriction enzyme digestion and DNA molecular hybridization with human papillomavirus (HPV) probes. Although both lesions were positive for HPV 16, their respective restriction enzyme patterns had different HPV genetic arrangements, thereby demonstrating their distinctness. "
neoplasms,"Axillary lymphadenectomy for intraductal carcinoma of the breast. During a ten year period, 175 axillary lymph node dissections were done as part of the treatment for intraductal carcinoma of the breast; 98 patients were treated with modified radical mastectomy and 77 were treated by mammary preservation, consisting of excision of the lesion, axillary dissection and radiation therapy. One of 175 axillary node dissections yielded positive nodes. Axillary dissection for intraductal carcinoma of the breast is unlikely to yield involved nodes and is not indicated for use in most instances. It should be reserved for lesions demonstrating microinvasion. "
neoplasms,"Effects of carotenoids in cellular and animal systems. It has been suggested that carotenoid pigments may function as chemopreventive agents for reducing the risk of cancer in humans. Part of this suggestion rests on epidemiological evidence, and part rests on work done in cellular and animal systems. In this article, the experimental evidence for carotenoid inhibition of mutagenicity, malignant transformation, tumor formation, and immunoenhancement is reviewed. Although a mechanism for these effects cannot yet be identified, it is clear that the overwhelming evidence in these systems would indicate that carotenoids exert an important influence in modulating the actions of carcinogens. "
neoplasms,"Titrated intravenous barbiturates in the control of symptoms in patients with terminal cancer. Patients with terminal cancer may have a series of severe and dehumanizing physical and psychologic symptoms. To improve symptom control in the final days and hours of life, we administer intravenous barbiturates continuously to provide heavy sedation or continuous somnolence. Titrated dosage is then reduced to a minimum, after a desired steady-state has been achieved. Improved symptom control is provided, and the patient's dignity is maintained until death. "
neoplasms,"A vascular malformation mimicking an intracanalicular acoustic neurilemoma. Case report. A patient with an enhancing, completely intracanalicular mass on magnetic resonance imaging was operated on for a presumed acoustic neurilemoma, but was found at surgery to have an intracanalicular vascular malformation. This rare lesion should be distinguished from angiomatous change within an acoustic neurilemoma and in the past has been termed ""vascular tumor,"" ""hemangioma,"" or ""fibro-angioma."" The clinical distinctions between intracanalicular acoustic neurilemomas and intracanalicular vascular malformations and the ability of magnetic resonance imaging to distinguish between the two are discussed. "
neoplasms,"Effect of plasmapheresis on serum and CSF autoantibody levels in CNS paraneoplastic syndromes. We compared the effect of plasmapheresis on antineuronal autoantibody titers in the serum and CSF of 3 patients with CNS paraneoplastic syndromes. Plasmapheresis reduced the serum autoantibody titer to 20% of the initial levels in the 3 patients, but the CSF autoantibody titer decreased only in the patient with severe damage of the blood-brain barrier. "
neoplasms,Debulking of pelvic and para-aortic lymph node metastases in ovarian cancer with the cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator. Six patients with metastatic ovarian cancer with extensive involvement of the pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph nodes underwent surgical debulking with the Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator. Intraoperative and postoperative morbidity was minimal. It is suggested that this technique may be used for cytoreductive surgery in combination with standard surgical techniques. 
neoplasms,"Resection and reconstruction for soft-tissue sarcomas of the extremity. Soft-tissue sarcomas are uncommon malignant tumors, and when a diagnosis is made early, the patient has up to an 80% chance of surviving. In treating soft-tissue sarcomas, the goal of the surgeon is the prolongation of patient survival, the total eradication of local disease, and the minimization of functional deficits. In addition to treatment, this article discusses evaluation, histology, and staging. "
neoplasms,"Biology of basal cell carcinoma (Part II). Host-tumor relationships involve several factors that can enhance or suppress neoplastic growth. This second part of a review of basal cell carcinoma biology examines the role that hormones, cytokines, local and systemic immunity, congenital and genetic syndromes, and environmental factors play in the development of this neoplasm. Theories of etiology and pathogenesis are discussed, and transplantation and cell culture techniques used to study this cancer are explored. Valuable second-line therapies for treatment of multiple tumors are reviewed, and important areas of present and future research are emphasized. "
neoplasms,Resection of the superior vena cava for primary lung cancer: 5 years' survival. We describe a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the right lung that required a resection of the superior vena cava combined with a tracheal sleeve pneumonectomy. The superior vena cava was totally replaced with a polytetrafluoroethylene graft with 115 minutes cross-clamping of the superior vena cava. The patient remains healthy and the polytetrafluoroethylene graft remains patent 5 years 4 months after operation. 
neoplasms,"Buschke-Loewenstein tumor: verrucous carcinoma of the penis. The Buschke-Loewenstein tumor is an anogenital tumor of characteristic clinical and histologic pattern best considered as a low-grade, well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. This remarkable neoplasm and its features are reviewed in detail, stressing salient advances in our understanding of it. "
neoplasms,"The central (intraosseous) calcifying odontogenic cyst: an analysis of 215 cases. This study reviews and analyzes the clinical, radiographic, and histomorphologic features of the 215 cases of central calcifying odontogenic cyst (CCOC) reported in the literature. Based on the present information, a clinicopathologic classification of calcifying odontogenic cyst is proposed. The CCOC is also compared with its peripheral counterpart and the differences discussed. "
neoplasms,"Granulocytic sarcoma presenting as an epidural mass with acute paraparesis in an aleukemic patient. Granulocytic sarcomas are rare tumors composed of granulocytic precursor cells. They are most commonly encountered in patients with acute myelogenous leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders in blast crisis. Rarely, patients presenting with granulocytic sarcoma show no evidence of acute leukemia. The authors report an aleukemic patient with acute paraparesis from an epidural granulocytic sarcoma. Only five such cases have been reported previously. Immunoperoxidase stain for lysozyme and chloroacetate esterase stain were used to prove the myeloid origin of the tumor cells. "
neoplasms,"Physiologic and psychobehavioral research in oncology. A major thrust in research in psychosocial oncology is the study of the interaction of psychologic and physiologic variables. This discussion reviews the current status and future directions of such research. Areas addressed include pain, nausea and vomiting with chemotherapy, sexuality, effects of cancer on psychologic and neuropsychologic function, impact of psychologic factors on cancer and its treatment, and psychoneuroimmunology. In addition, specific recommendations for strategies to facilitate research in these areas of psychosocial oncology are proposed. "
neoplasms,"The reliability of frozen sections in the evaluation of surgical margins for melanoma. As the width of surgical margins declines, histologic evaluation of the margins is needed to assess the completeness of excision of a malignant melanoma. We studied 221 specimens in 59 patients and compared the interpretations of frozen and paraffin sections from the same block. Frozen sections had a sensitivity of 100% in detecting melanoma when present and a specificity of 90%. "
neoplasms,"Evidence of a local immune activation in cystic brain tumors. The fluid of cystic brain tumors was characterized with regard to the protein content. In most malignant tumors, the concentrations of immunoglobulins G and M (IgG and IgM) were higher relative to other proteins in the cyst fluid than in the serum of the same patient. A markedly elevated ratio of monomeric to pentameric IgM was detected in the cyst fluid of two patients with glioblastomas. The results indicate a local immunoglobulin synthesis in malignant cystic brain tumors. It is hypothesized that higher-than-expected concentrations of IgG and IgM in cyst fluid as compared to plasma are a sign of an ongoing immune response triggered by the tumor. "
neoplasms,Pigmented Bowen's disease arising from pigmented seborrheic keratoses. We report three cases of pigmented Bowen's disease that clinically and histologically had features of seborrheic keratoses. We speculate about the mechanism of pigmentation in these lesions and suggest that they arise from pigmented seborrheic keratoses. 
neoplasms,"Performing screening flexible sigmoidoscopy using colonoscopes: experience in 500 subjects. There is still controversy regarding the optimal length of flexible sigmoidoscopes. We performed screening distal colon examinations using 168-cm colonoscopes in 500 asymptomatic subjects who were unsedated and had sigmoidoscopy cleansing preparation. The mean depth of penetration was 66 cm and was similar in persons in whom the examination was discontinued because of poor preparation versus those with discomfort. Polyps were detected in 87 patients, but only 5 subjects had polyps detected above 60 cm. We conclude that in a group of unsedated subjects scheduled for flexible sigmoidoscopy after a sigmoidoscopy prep, the use of instruments longer than 60 cm gives very little additional yield. "
neoplasms,"Granular cell neoplasm of the extrahepatic biliary tree: morphological, ultrastructural, and immunohistochemical study and review of the literature. A recent case of a biliary granular cell tumor of the cystic duct prompted a literature review and an extensive pathological examination of the tumor in question. A total of 44 cases have been described mostly in black females. Most cases present with biliary symptoms, and simple surgical resection allows complete control of this benign condition. Granular cell tumors are most likely derived from neural crest cells. "
neoplasms,"Thermally induced 'nicotine' stomatitis. A case report. A palatal lesion resembling ""nicotine"" stomatitis was found in a woman who did not smoke. However, the patient frequently drank extremely hot beverages. After she was instructed to reduce the temperature of the beverages, the lesion almost completely resolved. This suggests that heat was the primary cause of this lesion and also implicates heat as the major cause of nicotine stomatitis. "
neoplasms,Syringomyelia as a postoperative sequela of the resection of a chordoma of the clivus: case report. Syringomyelia has been described frequently in association with various abnormalities of the skull base but rarely with tumors of the skull base. Syringomyelia as a postoperative sequela of surgery of the skull base has not been reported. The authors describe a case of cervical syringomyelia developing after the partial resection of a chordoma and combined conventional and proton beam irradiation. The possible mechanisms causing this abnormality are discussed. 
neoplasms,Vascular abnormalities in epidermal nevus syndrome. We report a patient with epidermal nevus syndrome and right hemispheric infarct and review 3 others with neurologic manifestations best explained by ischemia or hemorrhage. Each had a significant vascular abnormality such as occlusion or blood vessel dysplasia. None had hemimegalencephaly. We hypothesize that underlying vascular dysplasia is the cause of the neurologic lesions in these patients. 
neoplasms,"Monomorphic adenomas of the major salivary glands: clinicopathological study of 44 cases. We report 44 cases of monomorphic adenoma (MA) of the major salivary glands observed during the years 1979-1989. All of these tumours were reviewed and classified on the basis of the World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria. Histological type, site, sex and age were considered. 34 cases of adenolymphoma were observed, all of them located in the parotid glands; 10 MA without lymphoid stroma were located in both parotid and submandibular glands. Distinctive histological and clinico-pathological features of the latter group of tumours are discussed, as well as the diagnostic criteria in distinguishing these tumours from pleomorphic adenoma and adenoid-cystic carcinoma. "
neoplasms,Multiple myeloma and bullous lichenoid lesions: an unusual association. Many associations of lichenoid reactions have been described but this case appears to be a previously unreported association--with multiple myeloma. This case also demonstrates the necessity of a mucosal biopsy with adequate hematologic and serologic investigations to obtain a definitive diagnosis. 
neoplasms,"Esthesioneuroblastoma with intracranial extension. The authors present five cases of olfactory neuroblastoma with intracranial extension operated on in the Department of Neurosurgery in collaboration with otorhinolaryngologists. This tumor is most frequently reported as growing inside the nasal cavities, and it can extend to the paranasal sinuses. Cases presenting initially as intracranial tumors have been infrequently reported. At present, histological diagnosis of this tumor is aided by the use of electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry. Total resection combined with radiation therapy remains the most satisfactory treatment. "
neoplasms,"Measurement techniques for melanoma: a statistical comparison Inter- and intra-observer variation in measuring the depth of invasion of malignant melanomas was assessed using three different techniques: eye-piece graticule, stage Vernier, and projection image analysis. Significant variation was found for all methods but was least pronounced with the stage Vernier. It is recommended that this should be the preferred technique for routine use. "
neoplasms,"Perinatal transmission of human papillomavirus. Human papillomavirus infection is probably the most prevalent sexually transmitted disease in the United States. In adults, it is associated with condylomata acuminata and with neoplastic changes ranging from dysplasia to carcinoma. Infected mothers may transmit human papillomavirus during the perinatal period; affected children face prolonged, difficult treatment for respiratory papillomatosis. Prevention of infection remains the best approach, since diagnostic and therapeutic methods are suboptimal. "
neoplasms,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in invasive bladder cancer: the evolving role of surgery. The role of an operation in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for clinically localized but invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder currently is evolving. An operation is essential for case selection and evaluation of local response but it also contributes to bladder preservation and survival. The procedure that is necessary to select for and assess response to chemotherapy may itself alter the actual or proceed to evolution of invasive bladder cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a reasonable therapeutic strategy in selected patients but it remains to be seen whether the results will prove to be superior to those achieved with standard endoscopic and open operations. 
neoplasms,Left atrial bacterial mural endocarditis. An unusual case of Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis confined to the mural left atrium is presented. Echocardiographic studies revealed a 1.5 x 2.0-cm vegetation mimicking a myxoma situated in the path of a mitral regurgitant jet on a color Doppler test. Emboli to upper and lower extremities and brain complicated the patient's preoperative course. Surgical excision and pathologic examination confirmed this rare occurrence. 
neoplasms,"Sacral plexus injury after radiotherapy for carcinoma of cervix. A 42-year-old woman developed lower extremity weakness and sensory loss 1 year after external and intracavitary radiotherapy for Stage IB carcinoma of cervix. She has been followed for 5 years posttreatment, and the neurologic abnormalities have persisted, but no evidence of recurrent carcinoma has been found. We believe this to be a rare case of sacral plexus radiculopathy developing as a late complication after radiotherapy. Suggestions are made for improving the radiotherapy technique to prevent this complication in future cases. "
neoplasms,"Acute T-cell leukemia/lymphoma mimicking Hodgkin's disease with secondary HTLV I seroconversion. The authors observed a pleiomorphic lymphoma mimicking Hodgkin's lymphoma in a French Guyana black woman lacking antibodies for human T-cell lymphoma/leukemia virus type I (HTLV I). After two courses of chemotherapy with either mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) or doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincaleukoblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD), a typical acute T-cell leukemia/lymphoma developed with HTLV I seroconversion. Specific HTLV I DNA sequences were detected using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on a lymph node biopsy obtained before chemotherapy. The mechanisms of the seroconversion are discussed. "
neoplasms,"Retinal vasculitis as a complication of rheumatoid arthritis. Two middle-aged women developed retinal vasculitis in the moderately active phase of classical rheumatoid arthritis. Fluorescein angiography disclosed diffuse leakage from the retinal capillaries and cystoid macular edema, which subsided in response to oral steroid. They did not show any clinical signs of vasculitis in other parts of the body. Retinal vasculitis should be included in the list of complications observed in rheumatoid arthritis. "
neoplasms,"Histopathologic evidence of fibrovascular ingrowth four weeks after placement of the hydroxyapatite orbital implant. We studied the histopathologic findings after placement of an orbital hydroxyapatite implant in a patient. The implant was placed after enucleation for a choroidal melanoma and was removed four weeks later because histopathologic examination of the enucleated globe disclosed tumor invasion of the optic nerve that necessitated further orbital tissue removal. Our histopathologic findings confirm that there is significant ingrowth of fibrovascular tissue in these implants, even within weeks of implantation. "
neoplasms,"Sensitivity of urinary quantitative immunocytology with monoclonal antibody 486 P3/12 in 241 unselected patients with bladder carcinoma. We investigated the sensitivity of quantitative immunocytology with our monoclonal antibody 486 P3/12 in 241 unselected patients with transitional cell carcinoma. Immunocytology yielded a sensitivity of 91.8%, 89.4% and 92.9% for grade 1, 2 and 3 tumors, respectively. Standard cytology was positive in 59.2%, 63.8% and 84.7%, respectively. Deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometry, used in the first 69 patients, was positive in only 27.7%, 48.6% and 57.1%, respectively. "
neoplasms,"The role of gastric resection in the management of multicentric argyrophil gastric carcinoids. A patient with pernicious anemia, atrophic non-antral gastritis, hypergastrinemia, and widespread hyperplasia of enterochromaffin-like cells and manifest enterochromaffin-like cell carcinoma was followed up during 39 months, including 15 months after gastric resection. In this case normalization of gastrin levels did not prevent the development of multiple gastric carcinoids in the fundic mucosa, suggesting that factors other than gastrin are of importance in the pathogenesis. "
neoplasms,Peripheral ameloblastoma with clear cell differentiation. This report details a case of mandibular peripheral ameloblastoma having a clear cell component. The latter consisted of ovoid cells with vacuolated or clear cytoplasm and vesicular or pyknotic nuclei that may be disposed as discrete clusters or show direct transition from typical acanthomatous areas. Comparison of this lesion with other odontogenic and nonodontogenic tumors that contain clear cells is discussed in the context of the differential diagnosis. 
neoplasms,"The interferon system in carcinoma of the cervix. Effect of radiation and chemotherapy. Thirteen patients with advanced carcinoma of the cervix were studied for parameters of the interferon system compared with 40 age-matched and sex-matched controls. All patients had measurable serum interferon levels; controls did not. All patients had non-antibody-type interferon-inhibitory activity, and controls had none. Interferon-synthesizing potential was higher in controls than in patients. After successful radiation and chemotherapy, these parameters normalized in the patients. No change was seen in one patient who did not respond to therapy. "
neoplasms,"Rhabdomyosarcoma of the ciliary body. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common malignant orbital tumor of childhood. It has twice been reported to arise within the globe from the iris. In addition, teratoid medulloepithelioma, a tumor arising from the ciliary epithelium, can contain a rhabdomyoblastic component, often in combination with other heteroplastic elements. The authors report what may be the first recorded case of an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the ciliary body, possibly representing a one-sided differentiation of a malignant teratoid medulloepithelioma. "
neoplasms,Tethered cord syndrome from a choristoma of mullerian origin. Case report. The authors report a case of tethered cord syndrome due to a choristoma of mullerian origin located in the spinal cord at the lumbosacral junction. Two similar cases were found upon review of the literature. The embryology of this lesion is discussed. 
neoplasms,Giant sclerosing leiomyoma of bladder presenting as chronic renal failure. The clinical and pathologic features of a case of giant sclerosing leiomyoma of the bladder in a male Polynesian patient are reported. The presenting complication of chronic renal failure due to tumor envelopment of both ureters and consequent bilateral renal obstruction appears to be unique in the literature. 
neoplasms,"Cystic dilatation of the cystic duct: a new type of biliary cyst. A case of a patient with a congenital cyst that was localized solely to the cystic duct is presented. We propose including this anomaly in the biliary cyst classifications, which currently include choledochal and intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary cysts. The diagnosis and management of this new type of cyst in addition to other types of biliary cysts are discussed. "
neoplasms,"Neodymium:YAG laser treatment of bladder hemangiomas. We present 3 cases of bladder hemangiomas, one single and two multiple, with a long-term history of recurrent hematuria, treated with endoscopic neodymium:YAG (yttrium, aluminum, garnet) laser photocoagulation, and obtaining good results. "
neoplasms,"Lymphoma presenting as a popliteal mass in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis. A patient with HLA-B27 and rheumatoid factor positive rheumatoid arthritis presented with a painless swelling in his popliteal fossa. Clinical features were atypical for a Baker's cyst, and subsequent investigation showed this lesion to be a primary malignant lymphoma. "
neoplasms,"Prevention of renal disease and conservation of renal function. In summary, we have reviewed some of the most frequently encountered areas of prevention of renal failure in the elderly. They include obstruction, hypertension, drug interaction, and inappropriate use of drugs and the silent killer of the elderly, renal carcinoma. Only by a thorough understanding of the altered physiology of the aging kidney can the physician avoid making the same mistakes when new drugs are developed or new types of diseases are encountered. Proper early diagnosis and understanding the guidelines to therapy in these conditions, can save huge human costs in terms of mortality, morbidity, and money. "
neoplasms,"Pancreatic carcinoma in an elderly woman with an organic affective disorder and AIDS delusion. An elderly woman with symptoms of depression and an AIDS delusion was found also to have pancreatic carcinoma. I have discussed her case in conjunction with organic affective disorder, the evaluation of depression in the elderly, and suicide in the elderly. "
neoplasms,"Bone lesions secondary to benign phaeochromocytoma. Four cases in childhood. Metaphyseal sclerotic bone changes associated with benign phaeochromocytoma are very rare in childhood. We report four cases, in each of which the radiographic changes returned to normal after removal of the tumour. "
neoplasms,"Intracranial chordoma in a preadolescent. Case report. Chordomas are rare tumors derived from notochord remnants occurring primarily in the sacrum, clivus, and cervical regions. Exceptionally, these tumors occur in children, though usually in the sacrum. Eight cases of clivus chordoma have been described in preteenagers. In this report, a clival chordoma with unusual radiologic features is described in an 11-year-old boy. The literature regarding this entity is reviewed. "
neoplasms,"Cystic mesothelioma of peritoneum: occurrence in a man. We report a case of cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum in a 54-year-old man in whom cystic masses were removed twice by surgery at an interval of 2 years. The patient died of cardiac arrest shortly after the second operation for a concurrent unresectable colonic cancer. The pathogenesis of the disease is uncertain, but we consider it neoplastic of low grade malignancy. "
neoplasms,"The vascularized fibula graft in mandibular reconstruction. The use of a vascularized graft from the fibula for mandibular reconstruction is presented. The great strength, pliability, and long vascular pedicle that characterize such grafts make them particularly suitable for this type of repair. The results in six cases were highly satisfactory. Masticatory function was well restored, without alteration of the facial contour, and with minimal sequelae at the donor site. "
neoplasms,"Blepharospasm-oromandibular dystonia associated with a left cerebellopontine angle meningioma. Blepharospasm-oromandibular dystonia is characterized by the presence of spasms of the orbicularis oculi (blepharospasm) and of the lower facial or oromandibular muscles. A patient with this syndrome is presented in which a left cerebellopontine angle meningioma appeared to act as a triggering mechanism for the development of this disorder. On the basis of this report, we recommend that physicians search for this tumor in patients with this disorder. "
neoplasms,"Infarct of the conus medullaris simulating a spinal cord tumor: case report. A 71-year-old woman had the sudden onset of a neurogenic bladder and a stepwise increase in paraparesis that left her unable to stand or walk. Magnetic resonance imaging showed what appeared to be a tumor in the conus medullaris. After laminectomy, the lesion was localized by ultrasound examination, and a biopsy was performed. The deficits remained unchanged postoperatively. Microscopic examination of the biopsy specimen showed necrosis and pathologic changes consistent with infarction of the conus medullaris. An anomalous arterial supply of the conus medullaris is the most likely cause of this unusual problem. The patient gradually regained her ability to walk, but the neurogenic bladder persists. "
neoplasms,"Pheochromocytoma in the pediatric age group: the prostate--an unusual location. Pheochromocytomas of the prostate are rare, with only 3 cases in adults reported in the literature. We present the case of an 8-year-old boy with a pheochromocytoma of the prostate and a second tumor in the region of the left internal iliac artery. "
neoplasms,"An unusual epidural, vascular spinal lipoma in a 3-year-old child: a case report and review of the literature. Epidural lipomas are usually benign tumors affecting the spinal cord. We report the unusual presentation of a cervicothoracic spinal lipoma associated with a cervical dysraphism in a young boy. Diagnostic options using magnetic resonance imaging and gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid are discussed as a pathway to early diagnosis of these and other occult spinal lesions. "
neoplasms,"Malignant potential of juvenile polyposis coli. Report of a case and review of the literature. Juvenile polyps of the colon and rectum traditionally have been viewed as being benign inflammatory or harmartomatous lesions without potential for malignant change. The authors report a case of adenocarcinoma developing in a patient with sporadic juvenile polyposis. Juvenile polyposis was diagnosed in the patient at age 4 years. He underwent subtotal colectomy at age 6 years. At age 12, he underwent a proctectomy and a Swenson pull-through because of adenomatous changes in the rectal stump. At age 19 surveillance endoscopy revealed invasive cancer in a juvenile polyp. "
neoplasms,Gastric duplication cyst communicating with the pancreatic duct: a rare cause of recurrent abdominal pain. A 41-year-old woman with recurrent attacks of postprandial abdominal pain was found on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and subsequent computed tomographic scan to have an enteric duplication within the substance of the pancreas with communication to the pancreatic duct. Celiotomy demonstrated a noncontiguous gastric duplication cyst. Internal drainage was curative. 
neoplasms,"'Locked-in syndrome' for 27 years following a viral illness: clinical and pathologic findings. We describe a man who, after a presumed encephalitic illness, was ""locked-in"" for 27 years. His CT and autopsy findings showed atrophy of the brainstem and a cystic lesion at the base of the pons. He survived longer than most other patients in a similar state. "
neoplasms,"Staging of ureteral transitional cell carcinoma by CT and MRI. Intravenous urography and retrograde pyelography are the primary radiologic studies for detecting ureteral carcinoma but give limited information regarding stage of disease. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) delineate the extent of ureteral carcinomas with a high degree of accuracy by depicting the periureteral fat and presence or absence of lymphadenopathy. In selected cases, CT and MRI are valuable for assessing the presence or absence of tumor in a ureteral stump and for the differential diagnosis of ureteral obstruction. Five cases of ureteral carcinoma and 2 cases of stump carcinoma are presented with preoperative CT and/or MRI evaluation and staging. "
neoplasms,"Partial and total penectomy for cancer. Squamous carcinoma of the penis remains an uncommon tumor in the United States. In the properly selected patient, partial or total penectomy performed with an understanding of the salient surgical anatomy results in adequate local control of these cancers with excellent functional and cosmetic results. "
neoplasms,"Mammographic follow-up of low-suspicion lesions: compliance rate and diagnostic yield. All recommendations for mammographic follow-up of low-suspicion lesions seen at mammography during a 6-month period were reviewed to establish compliance rate and eventual outcome. One hundred forty-four of 2,650 mammograms (5%) showed minimal abnormalities that warranted short-term and periodic mammographic follow-up. Rates of compliance at 4 months and at 1, 2, and 3 years were 88%, 71%, 60%, and 47%, respectively. Progressive mammographic change was found in 10 patients, only one of whom had a carcinoma. It was concluded that mammographic follow-up of low-suspicion lesions is a reasonable alternative to surgical biopsy, although patient compliance remains a significant problem. "
neoplasms,"Atheroemboli to the lower urinary tract: a marker of atherosclerotic vascular disease--a case report. Atheroemboli to the lower genitourinary tract may serve as a marker for disseminated atheroembolic disease, a highly lethal condition. A case presentation and review of our institional experience is presented. "
neoplasms,Hemangiopericytoma of the sciatic nerve. Case report. The authors report the case of a hemangiopericytoma arising in a sciatic nerve. It was found to be invasive within the epineurium but sparing surrounding tissues. Adequate resection required sacrifice of the nerve. Hemangiopericytomas can be added to the short list of mesodermal peripheral-nerve tumors. 
neoplasms,"Lip paresthesia associated with a jaw mass. A case is reported in which mandibular swelling and lower lip numbness were the first signs of a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung. The development of paresthesia, with or without other oral symptoms, requires that a diagnosis of malignancy be considered until confirmed or ruled out by tissue biopsy. A thorough head and neck examination in all patients, especially in those whose history or habits may indicate increased risk of malignancy is necessary. "
neoplasms,"A surgical approach to the cervicothoracic spine. We describe a method for approaching the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine, the brachial plexus and related vessels. The method involves the elevation of the medial corner of the manubrium, the sternoclavicular joint, and the medial half of the clavicle on a pedicle of the sternomastoid muscle. We have used this exposure in 17 cases with few complications and good results. Its successful performance requires high standards of anaesthesia, surgical technique and postoperative care. "
neoplasms,Intradural epithelial cyst at the craniovertebral junction. Case report. A case of an intradural epithelial cyst at the craniovertebral junction is reported in a 37-year-old man. The classification of these rare lesions is discussed. 
neoplasms,"Abnormal epidermal changes after argon laser treatment. A 26-year-old woman with a congenital port-wine stain on the forehead was treated three times at 2-month intervals with an argon laser. Six months after the last treatment, moderate blanching and mild scaling confined to the treated area was observed. A biopsy specimen of the treated area revealed a significant decrease in ectatic vessels. However, epidermal changes similar to those of actinic keratosis with disorganized cell layers and marked cytologic abnormalities were seen. Analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes for a defect in DNA repair was negative. Multiple, argon laser-induced photothermal effects may be responsible for the changes observed in our case and may lead to premalignant epidermal transformation. "
neoplasms,"Stiffman syndrome: a rare paraneoplastic disorder? An unusual case of the stiffman syndrome, associated with an oat cell carcinoma of the bronchus, is reported. Pathological examination showed that it was due to an encephalomyelitis similar to that seen in paraneoplastic disorders. This suggests that atypical cases of the stiffman syndrome may occasionally be paraneoplastic. "
neoplasms,"Giant hemangioma of the liver with pain, fever, and abnormal liver tests. Report of two cases. In conclusion, we report the cases of two patients with large hemangiomas of the liver, abdominal pain, increased ESR and fibrinogen, increased serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase activity, and normal white blood cell counts. Clinical and biochemical abnormalities disappeared after surgical resection. Increased ESR and fibrinogen are probably related to thrombosis within the tumor. This mode of presentation may suggest a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. "
neoplasms,"Genital human papillomavirus infection Human papillomavirus is one of the most common causes of sexually transmitted diseases. In the past ten years, 60 different types of papillomavirus have been identified. Although the virus often causes asymptomatic genital infection, it has been strongly associated with lower genital tract carcinoma; therefore, its detection and eradication are important. All patients with evidence of human papillomavirus infection should undergo colposcopy and, depending on the extent of infection and the type of histology, should receive definitive treatment. "
neoplasms,The development of neutralizing antibodies in a patient receiving subcutaneous recombinant and natural interleukin-2. Systemic administration of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in humans may induce antibodies specific to IL-2. The case is reported of a patient with metastatic rectal carcinoma who was treated with long-term subcutaneous IL-2 and a combination of subcutaneous IL-2 and interferon-alpha 2b (IFN-alpha 2b). This patient developed nonneutralizing and neutralizing anti-IL-2 antibodies recognizing both the recombinant and natural cytokine. Detectable serum levels of neutralizing antibodies were accompanied by the inhibition of immune responsiveness to systemic IL-2 in vivo. 
neoplasms,"Paraneoplastic brachial plexopathy in a patient with Hodgkin's disease. We describe a case of inflammatory brachial plexopathy that occurred in the context of a mild, diffuse sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy associated with Hodgkin's disease. Clinical, electrophysiologic, and pathologic studies helped distinguish this disorder from other causes of brachial plexopathy in patients with cancer. Treatment with corticosteroids seemed beneficial in this patient. We suggest that this may be another type of paraneoplastic condition associated with Hodgkin's disease. "
neoplasms,"Regressing atypical histiocytosis. Aberrant prothymocyte differentiation, T-cell receptor gene rearrangements, and nodal involvement. Two cases of regressing atypical histiocytosis were studied. New findings reported include the presence of CD1 epitope on large atypical histiocytoid cells and apparent early lymph node involvement. Because regressing atypical histiocytosis may demonstrate aberrant thymic differentiation antigen expression and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements, initial lymph node involvement, and eventuation in conventional lymphoma in some cases, the alternative term regressing-phase anaplastic lymphoma is proposed as a more accurate designation for this entity. "
neoplasms,"Acquired childhood aphasia. Outcome 1 year after onset. The effects of the variables age at onset, cause, severity and bilaterality of lesion, and type of aphasia on course and outcome were investigated in a group of 28 aphasic children. Analysis of spontaneous speech and tests of auditory verbal comprehension were used to determine the presence of aphasia. The severity of the cerebral lesion was assessed using a rating scale for computed tomographic scans. Most of the children had not recovered completely 1 year after onset. Recovery was significantly different according to etiological categories. Complete recovery was seen in the majority of traumatic cases. "
neoplasms,"Recurrence of acoustic neurilemoma as a malignant spindle-cell neoplasm. Case report. A 75-year-old man presented with a right cerebellopontine angle tumor 11 months after complete macroscopic resection of a right acoustic neurilemoma. Histological examination of the recurrent tumor showed a malignant spindle-cell neoplasm with positive staining for S-100 protein. The patient had no stigmata of von Recklinghausen's disease. It is proposed that this recurrence represents progression from a benign to a malignant acoustic nerve-sheath tumor, an event that is extremely rare outside the clinicopathological context of neurofibromatosis. "
neoplasms,Management of subglottic stenosis in the adult. Twenty-one adult patients were surgically treated for severe subglottic stenosis refractory to endoscopic treatment. Patients were treated by anterior or anterior and posterior cricoid division with costal cartilage grafting. Seventy-six percent of the patients were successfully decannulated. Success of treatment was not dependent on cause of the stenosis or age or sex of the patient. There was a significantly better outcome (p less than .05) in patients with isolated subglottic stenosis versus those with combined glottic and subglottic stenosis. 
neoplasms,Invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the mandible presenting as a chronic osteomyelitis: report of a case. A case of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the mandible initially thought to be chronic osteomyelitis is reviewed. Discussion of the origin of the tumor and several imaging techniques used for differentiating maxillofacial infection from neoplasm are discussed. The difficulty of diagnosis of chronic painful maxillofacial lesions illustrates the need for a high degree of suspicion concerning any inflammatory lesion not responding to appropriate therapy. Accurate diagnosis and treatment of such lesions most often necessitates microscopic examination. 
neoplasms,"Radiographic manifestations of anomalies of the brain. Congenital brain anomalies are classified as developmental anomalies, effects of teratogens, errors of histogenesis, or sequelae of infections. The imaging options for delineation of these anomalies are many; a basic understanding of the disorder is central to the effective choice of imaging modality. This review begins with a brief overview of embryogenesis then reviews the common congenital brain anomalies encountered in infants. "
neoplasms,"Obstructing carcinoma of the cecum. Carcinoma of the cecum, the third most common location for malignancy of the large bowel, was examined with attention centered upon cecal cancers producing obstruction. Reviewing 136 patients revealed 11 obstructing lesions (8.1%) presenting as distal small bowel obstructions. The mean age of the patients was 74 years. All but one patient had resection for cure which consisted of a right hemicolectomy with ileotransverse colostomy. There was no operative mortality or significant morbidity. Bowel obstruction due to cecal carcinoma is an infrequent occurrence arising in elderly patients and carries a poor survival rate due to advanced disease at the time of diagnosis and treatment. "
neoplasms,"Malignant melanoma occurring during pregnancy: a report of the Northern Israel Oncology Center (1968-1988). Medical records of seven patients treated within a 20 year period for malignant melanoma during pregnancy were reviewed. No significant detrimental prognostic effects could be attributed to pregnancy. The current literature on melanoma and pregnancy is discussed. Based on this, pregnancy seems not to be contraindicated in melanoma patients. "
neoplasms,"Choroidal osteoma (osseous choristoma): an atypical case. A case of choroidal osteoma presenting in a 22-year-old girl is reported. The tumour, unilateral and in a juxtapapillary site, appeared markedly elevated on the retinal plane, not flat or slightly elevated as in previous reports. Visual acuity was not affected, and there was a complete absence of subjective symptoms. Echography, fluorangiography, computerised tomography, and visual field tests were performed. Echography is the best method for identifying and differentiating this lesion from a malignant tumour. "
neoplasms,"Gestational trophoblastic disease of the fallopian tube. Tubal gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) was diagnosed in 16 (0.8%) of 2,100 women with GTD managed at the New England Trophoblastic Disease Center. Tubal partial mole, complete mole and choriocarcinoma were present in 5, 5 and 6 patients, respectively. Patients with tubal GTD were not clinically distinguishable from those with traditional tubal pregnancies. While only one patient with tubal mole developed metastases, four patients with tubal choriocarcinoma presented with metastases. All the patients achieved complete, sustained remission. "
neoplasms,"The use of L-dopa and carbidopa in metastatic malignant melanoma. A combination of L-dopa and carbidopa was given orally to 17 patients with metastatic melanoma. Maximum tolerated oral doses were given, up to 4 grams daily. No response was seen in 15 patients evaluable for response. Toxicity was considerable, with seven of 17 patients (41%) stopping treatment because of unacceptable gastrointestinal toxicity or postural hypotension. Contrary to previous anecdotal reports, there was no evidence that L-dopa/carbidopa treatment resulted in accelerated progression of metastatic melanoma. Orally administered L-dopa/carbidopa is ineffective as therapy for advanced melanoma when maximum tolerated doses are used. "
neoplasms,"Hepatic cyst associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. A solitary hepatic cyst, associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, is described. To our knowledge, this association has not been previously reported. A developmental anomaly or hamartomatous nature of this lesion is suggested. Knowledge of this association may be helpful in the clinical diagnosis of this benign entity. "
neoplasms,"Merkel cell carcinoma metastatic to the testis. Tumor metastases to the testes are rare and are usually found incidentally at autopsy or after orchiectomy for prostatic carcinoma. It is even more unusual for testicular metastases to be clinically detected or symptomatic. The authors report two cases of clinically detected testicular metastases from Merkel cell carcinoma of the skin. Merkel cell carcinoma metastatic to the testes has not been reported previously. The two tumors, to some degree, resembled testicular lymphomas and the interstitial type of seminoma. "
neoplasms,"Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the brain after Hodgkin's disease. An immunohistochemical study. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of the central nervous system (CNS) is a rarely reported complication of Hodgkin's disease (HD). Two patients with NHL of the brain after HD were studied by histologic and immunohistochemical methods. Both patients were in the second decade, had been treated with radiation and chemotherapy, had experienced a relapse of HD before development of NHL, had no evidence of HD at the time of diagnosis of NHL, and died within 1 year of diagnosis. Both brain neoplasms were large cell immunoblastic lymphomas of B-cell lineage. Patients with HD appear to be at increased risk for NHL of the CNS, which may have a poor prognosis. "
neoplasms,"The human costs of cancer and the response of the National Cancer Program. The three foundations of the National Cancer Program are basic research, clinical trials (in prevention and treatment), and cancer centers. These foundations have supported a great deal of progress against cancer over the past 20 years. Nevertheless, a number of challenges remain, and continued progress will depend on the speed with which research advances can be translated into practical realities. Poverty is a risk factor for cancer incidence and mortality. Thus, a lack of access to the technologies generated by the National Cancer Program can be a force for bringing about differential burdens of cancer in underserved populations. "
neoplasms,"Acoustic schwannoma and epidermoid cyst occurring as a single cerebellopontine angle mass. The case of a 66-year-old man with a 3-year progressive hearing loss and a homogeneous left cerebellopontine angle mass on magnetic resonance imaging scan is described. At surgery, the major portion of the mass was a typical encapsulated, solid, acoustic schwannoma, but the most rostral portion was a distinct, flaky, cystic mass without a well-defined capsule, typical of an epidermoid cyst. The radiographic and operative findings of this unique coexistence of two different benign cerebellopontine angle masses are presented. "
neoplasms,Distribution of bony metastases in prostatic carcinoma. Fifty-five prostate cancer and 55 breast cancer patients with positive bone scintigrams were studied. The pattern of spread in the axial skeleton and pelvis showed differences between the 2 groups. This difference was not related primarily to bone volume at the site of metastasis. The difference in distribution of bony metastases between breast and prostate is explained by our knowledge of Batson's vertebral venous plexus. 
neoplasms,"Endometrioma. An intra-abdominal troublemaker. A ten-year review of intestinal and abdominal wall endometriomas is reported. Seven cases of intestinal and two cases of abdominal wall endometriomas are presented. Symptoms were varied but a majority had some gynecologic complaint. In this select group of patients, preoperative investigations did not assist in establishing the diagnosis. All patients underwent surgery and coexisting inflammatory bowel disease was present in two patients. This review suggests that endometrioma of the intestine requires a high index of suspicion for diagnosis and that danazol does not appear to be effective treatment for these patients. "
neoplasms,"Renal vein leiomyosarcoma. The 11th case of primary leiomyosarcoma of the renal vein is reported. Unique features of this case included concomitant resection of an isolated hepatic metastasis, intraoperative radiation therapy, and the use of electron microscopy and immunohistochemical stains in confirming the diagnosis. A review of the previously reported cases shows a tendency toward slow tumor growth and infrequent recurrence (18%). Metastases are common (82%), primarily to the lung and liver. Aggressive surgical resection and adjuvant radiation therapy, including intraoperative radiation therapy, are recommended. Adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered, although its benefits at present are unclear. "
neoplasms,"Neonatal subependymal giant cell astrocytoma associated with tuberous sclerosis: MRI, CT, and ultrasound correlation. We describe a term newborn with tuberous sclerosis who presented with a neonatal brain tumor, diagnosed as a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. We compare the various imaging modalities used in the diagnosis of this tumor. "
neoplasms,Numb chin syndrome secondary to Burkitt's cell acute leukemia. We describe a case of Burkitt's cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia presenting with the bilateral numb chin syndrome as the initial symptom of the disease. Postmortem study of the trigeminal nerve showed heavy infiltrations of leukemic cells and destruction of axon and myelin by leukemic cells in the mandibular nerve. 
neoplasms,"Recurrent intracaval renal cell carcinoma: the role of intravascular ultrasonography. The presence of extension into the vena cava does not preclude curative resection for extensive renal cell carcinomas. However, preoperative assessment of (1) the proximal extent of the tumor and (2) the degree of adherence within the vena cava is necessary to plan operative strategies. The following report describes the successful use of intravascular ultrasonography in the preoperative evaluation of a patient with recurrent renal cell carcinoma with vena caval extension. "
neoplasms,"Mohs micrographic surgery. Mohs micrographic surgery is a versatile technique for the treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancers, especially recurrent, invasive, or infiltrating basal cell carcinomas. It provides unsurpassed cure rates by using 100% surgical margin control, and it achieves maximal preservation of normal tissue. At the conclusion of tumor extirpation, the defect is ready for immediate reconstruction. With better understanding of the Mohs micrographic surgery technique, it can be more effectively used as part of a coordinated multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of patients with difficult cutaneous and paracutaneous neoplasms. "
neoplasms,"Relationship between blood plasma prostaglandin E2 and liver and lung metastases in colorectal cancer. The relationship of prostaglandin E2, of which a large amount is produced in various neoplasms, and hematogenous distant metastases was investigated in a total of 44 colorectal cancer patients because of its varied pathophysiologic potentials. The authors found significantly high levels of PGE2 in local venous blood draining the carcinoma and in peripheral blood in cases with liver or lung metastasis, as well as a significantly large amount of PGE2 production in the carcinoma tissue. The results suggest that increased local blood PGE2 could enhance the metastasis formation, and increased peripheral blood PGE2 may be useful in the detection of such metastasis in colorectal cancer. "
neoplasms,"Intradural chordoma of the tentorium cerebelli. Case report. A rare case of intradural chordoma is described. The literature contains seven examples of intradural extraosseous chordoma, all reported in a ventral location. This is the first reported case of a primary intradural chordoma distant from the clivus and involving both the supra- and infratentorial compartments. "
neoplasms,"Fertility-sparing treatment of patients with ovarian cancer. The variety of malignant neoplasms produced by the ovary are legion. Each must be considered individually in the young woman with early disease who wishes to preserve her childbearing capability. The risks of conservative surgery are often low, and the patient can be so advised. Careful monitoring of this group of patients is essential regardless of the approach. "
neoplasms,"Laryngeal metastasis from colonic adenocarcinoma. Metastases to the larynx from distant primaries are very rare. Usually the secondary lesion comes from an hypernephroma or malignant melanoma. A case of metastatic laryngeal tumour from a colonic adenocarcinoma, occurring in a 59-year-old woman, is presented and the routes for laryngeal spread are discussed. The poor survival-rate of these patients justified only conservative surgery. "
neoplasms,"Adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's esophagus after total gastrectomy A 64-yr-old Japanese male who underwent a partial gastrectomy for a duodenal ulcer at the age of 21, a total resection of the remnant stomach for a stomal ulcer at age 25, and in whom Barrett's esophagus was diagnosed at age 47, was found to have a tumor at the distal esophagus and was operated on by thoracic esophagectomy. The tumor was a well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading down to the muscularis propria. The entire esophageal mucosa in the resected specimen was lined by columnar epithelium. This tumor was thought to derive from the Barrett's esophageal epithelium. "
neoplasms,"Endometriosis of the abdominal wall. Endometriosis of the abdominal wall typically occurs as a painful mass in a lower abdominal incision from previous cesarean section or hysterectomy. Most patients are young and in their active reproductive years. The histologic diagnosis requires a combination of either endometrial-like glands, endometrial stroma, or hemosiderin pigment. The diagnosis must be considered in any woman with an abdominal wall mass and a history of transabdominal gynecologic surgery. Wide excision offers the best chance to prevent recurrence. "
neoplasms,A hepatocellular carcinoma of massive arterioportal shunts without tumor stain treated with CDDP two-route chemotherapy--a case report. Massive arterioportal shunts without tumor vessels or tumor stain are sometimes encountered in advanced cases of liver cirrhosis. Massive arterioportal shunts without tumor stain that responded well to intensive chemotherapy with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II are reported. 
neoplasms,"An unusual organoid tumor. Alveolar soft part sarcoma or paraganglioma? The histogenesis of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a subject of continued debate. Although many recent reports suggest a muscle origin, others advocate a neuroendocrine derivation. A tumor in the chest wall of a 16-year-old woman was diagnosed and treated as ASPS. The light microscopic, electron microscopic, and immunohistochemical findings showed features of both ASPS and paraganglioma. In addition, this lesion was positive for antibody to glucagon, a characteristic of neither ASPS nor paraganglioma, although seen in a few gangliocytic paragangliomas. This case demonstrates the need for continued inquiry into the histogenesis of ASPS. "
neoplasms,"Lobulated intradermal nevus. Report of three cases. We report the cases of three patients with lobulated intradermal nevi. Biopsy specimens showed similar findings, that is, fatty infiltration within nests of nevus cells, neuroid differentiation of nevus cells, and dermal fibrosis. Our cases probably represent an unusual form of regressing melanocytic nevus. "
neoplasms,"Late metastases of cutaneous melanoma: case report and literature review. The development of delayed metastases, although rare, is well documented in patients with invasive cutaneous melanoma. Only 24 cases, including ours, are clearly documented in the literature. We describe a 56-year-old woman who had an acral lentiginous melanoma of the right hand (thickness 1.2 mm). Thirteen years after excision and postoperative irradiation, a subcutaneous metastasis developed in the right arm. One year later the patient died with disseminated bone metastases. This case, as with most of those with delayed metastases, has typical features: female sex; location at a site other than the back, arm, neck, or scalp; and primary tumor thickness between 1.2 and 2.5 mm. "
neoplasms,"Continent ileocolonic urinary reservoirs for filling and lining the post-exenteration pelvis. Pelvic exenteration has a high complication rate due, in large part, to the extensive raw surfaces and dead space it creates. Numerous techniques have been used to control this space and line these surfaces, but none, to date, has proven to be a reliable solution. We investigated the use of continent ileocolonic urinary reservoirs as a new ""flap"" to fill and line the pelvis in 17 patients, and found that our historical complication rate of 44% for pelvic exenteration was reduced to 18%. These reservoirs appear to be an improved method of managing the post-exenteration pelvis. "
neoplasms,"Introduction: nutritional aspects of palm oil. The production, composition, and food uses of palm oil are outlined in this introduction to a detailed appraisal of the nutritional and health implications of the use of palm oil in the food supply. The putative role of dietary fats and oils in general, and of palm oil in particular, in the etiology of coronary heart disease and cancer is critically assessed. It is concluded that the evidence available is difficult to interpret unambiguously. Some evidence to suggest that the minor components of palm oil might have useful biological effects is also discussed. "
neoplasms,"Cryptic osteoid osteoma of the cranium: case report. Osteoid osteoma is an uncommon benign tumor of bone that rarely involves the cranium. If often causes local pain that is worse at night, characteristically relieved by aspirin, and does not correlate with the size of the lesion. The diagnosis depends on skull radiographs and computed tomography. This report describes a case in which radiographs showed nothing abnormal. The diagnosis and operative localization were accomplished with radionuclide bone scanning. Thus, the possibility of radiographically cryptic lesions must be considered in the evaluation of atypical head pain syndromes. "
neoplasms,"Results of surgical treatment of kidney cancer with solitary metastasis to contralateral adrenal. A large series of patients were reviewed in two major teaching institutions, and patients with a carcinoma of the kidney with a solitary metastatic deposit in the contralateral adrenal were identified. Their survival was analyzed and compared with the survival of those patients having a solitary metastatic deposit in other organs. "
neoplasms,"Primary intracerebral sarcoma in childhood: case report with electron-microscope study. A case of a primary intracerebral sarcoma is described in a 5-year-old girl. Histology and immunohistochemistry excluded the diagnosis of a leiomyosarcoma, a malignant haemangiopericytoma or a fibrosarcoma; electron-microscopical findings indicated that the origin of the sarcoma was in the pia mater. "
neoplasms,"Preoperative cytology and mammography in patients with single-duct nipple discharge treated by surgery. Microdochectomy has been the routine management for single-duct nipple discharge. Our review of 176 consecutive patients surgically treated between 1975 and 1988 revealed eight patients with in situ carcinomas and seven with infiltrative carcinomas. Seventeen patients had multiple papillomas, two had atypical hyperplasia and two had atypical epitheliosis. Case selection for surgery has recently been advocated. In our study, nipple discharge cytology was helpful in 67 per cent of cases with underlying malignant pathology. Mammography was found to be unreliable, alerting suspicion in only two of 15 cases. "
neoplasms,"The 1989 presidential address. International Society for the Study of Vulvar Disease. Major changes in the terminology for vulvar disease have taken place in the past 20 years under the influence of the members of the International Society for the Study of Vulvar Disease. Major terminology changes have been made for vulvar nonneoplastic disorders, vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia and superficially invasive squamous cell carcinoma. "
neoplasms,The growing teratoma syndrome. Thirteen patients with metastatic non-seminomatous germ cell tumours and enlarging metastases consisting of teratoma differentiated only were identified. Patients were managed with surgical resection soon after the growing lesions were documented. Surgical morbidity was minimal and 12 patients are alive (10 are disease-free) at a median follow-up of 28 months. 
neoplasms,"Aqueductal (pencil) glioma presenting as neurogenic pulmonary edema: a case report. A case of neurogenic pulmonary edema due to hydrocephalus, without initial neurological deficit, is described. Computed tomography demonstrated a ring enhancing lesion in the tectum of the mesencephalon obstructing the aqueduct of Sylvius. The lesion, on autopsy, was a rare mesencephalic glioma described in the literature as a ""pencil glioma"" of the aqueduct. "
neoplasms,Total pelvic exenteration with simultaneous bowel and urinary reconstruction. The technique of total pelvic exenteration with simultaneous bowel and urinary reconstruction is described as a surgical option for the management of pelvic sarcoma in adults and for highly selected patients with other types of advanced pelvic malignancy. The surgical technique is presented in detail as performed in a 43-year-old man who presented with extensive primitive pelvic sarcoma. We believe that this approach may provide the benefits of an exenterative operation without the undesirable psychosocial sequelae of a permanent colostomy and external urinary diversion. 
neoplasms,"Gonadotroph adenoma of the pituitary mimicking a prolactinoma. In a 41-year-old woman with mild hyperprolactinemia and amenorrhea, preoperative hormonal and neuroradiological findings suggested the diagnosis of a macroprolactinoma. She underwent transsphenoidal surgery since the tumor size had not changed in spite of bromocriptine administration for 5 months. Consequently, this case was diagnosed as a female-type gonadotroph adenoma on the basis of its characteristic ultrastructural features including a honeycomb Golgi complex, even though endocrinological and immunohistochemical findings were not those of a typical gonadotroph adenoma. "
neoplasms,"Surgical resection of a solitary liver metastasis in a 46-year-old patient with a malignant thymoma. Clinical history, surgical treatment, and pathologic findings of a solitary liver metastasis of a malignant thymoma in a 46-year-old female are reported. An extensive literature review has revealed no record of surgical resection of liver metastasis in a patient with invasive thymoma. "
neoplasms,"Multicentric endobronchial granular cell myoblastoma. Granular cell myoblastoma (GCM) is a rare benign neoplasm involving the tracheobronchial tree. It is believed to arise from the Schwann cell. Four cases of tracheobronchial GCM, all of which were multicentric, are presented and a conservative therapeutic approach is suggested. "
neoplasms,Cystic hygroma: massive recurrence in adult life. Cystic hygroma is considered a disease of childhood. It may appear for the first time in adult life but recurrence by that stage is rare and may present difficulties in diagnosis due to previous treatment. The authors present a case where early pharmacological intervention may have prevented a potentially life threatening situation. The world literature is also reviewed. 
neoplasms,"Cardiac rhabdomyoma. Rare cause of fetal death. Two cases of nonimmune hydrops fetalis and fetal death associated with cardiac rhabdomyoma are reported. Case 1 presented with fetal supraventricular tachycardia, and cardiac rhabdomyoma was accurately diagnosed by fetal echocardiography. Autopsy revealed multiple rhabdomyomata involving the right atrial free wall, the sinoatrial node, and the left ventricle. The left circumflex coronary artery was extrinsically compressed by adjacent tumor tissue, causing left ventricular myocardial infarction. Case 2 had a unique, pedunculated, ball-like rhabdomyoma that almost totally occluded the mitral orifice. The causes of fetal death in patients with cardiac rhabdomyoma are analyzed and the possibility of fetal surgical management is proposed. "
neoplasms,"The internal oblique-iliac crest free flap in composite defects of the oral cavity involving bone, skin, and mucosa. The reconstruction of oromandibular defects following ablative surgery is a challenging undertaking. When the defect involves skin as well as mucosa, the challenge becomes even greater. The internal oblique iliac crest osteomyocutaneous free flap is particularly useful for reconstruction of through-and-through composite defects due to the inclusion of two separate soft-tissue flaps on the same vascular pedicle. We report our experience with this flap in the reconstruction of 10 patients with such defects. The utility, and the limitations of this form of reconstruction are discussed in detail. "
neoplasms,"Antibodies to synthetic peptide (125-148) of the alpha-subunit of human nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in sera from patients with myasthenia gravis. We measured the amount of antibodies to a synthetic peptide that corresponds to the alpha-subunit residues Lys125-Thr148 of human acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in myasthenic sera. We detected anti-peptide antibodies in 52% (89/171) of the patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), but none in any of the healthy controls. Anti-peptide antibodies should provide a valuable immunologic parameter for the clinical evaluation of MG, but no apparent correlation was observed between the titers of anti-peptide and anti-AChR antibodies. "
neoplasms,"Temporal bone: three-dimensional CT. Part II. Pathologic alterations. Three-dimensional (3D) surface renderings were obtained from routine axial computed tomographic (CT) images in 15 patients with a variety of complex temporal bone abnormalities. The 3D CT reformations served as an adjunct to conventional sectional CT examination. While no diagnosis was substantially changed because of the 3D CT images, they did provide a more global perspective in cases of large tumors and fractures and at the postmastoidectomy site. Three-dimensional CT surface reformations are now practical and may be potentially useful for visualizing temporal bone lesions characterized by complex destructive change. "
neoplasms,Intramedullary spinal ependymal cyst: case report. A cervical intramedullary spinal ependymal cyst in a 39-year-old man is reported. Diagnosis was made through magnetic resonance imaging. Total enucleation was possible. This is the sixth such reported case. 
neoplasms,"Osteoma of the middle ear. Report of a case. Osteomas of the middle ear are rare. We report a case of a 7-year-old boy with osteoma originating from the pyramidal eminence, combined with congenital cholesteatoma. The osteoma and cholesteatoma were successfully removed by tympanomastoidectomy. The long process of the incus and the superstructure of the stapes disappeared. The body of the incus was sculpted and used as a columella. Histopathologically, the osteoma was much the same as an external auditory canal osteoma. The possibility of a primary congenital origin of this neoplasm is suggested. "
neoplasms,"Resections and reconstructions for tumors of the distal radius. The primary objective in surgical management of the patient with a distal radius tumor is control of the disease. Accurate staging and diagnostic methods applied preoperatively will predict not only the amount of resection necessary to obtain adequate tumor margins, but also the amount of remaining bone and soft tissues to assist reconstruction. With this information, a method of reconstruction can be chosen that provides the patient optimal long-term function and stability with predictable results and the fewest potential complications. "
neoplasms,"Multimodality preoperative treatment for advanced stage IV (MO) cancer of the head and neck. Sixty-three patients with advanced unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were treated with a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. We observed a 75% response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The 5-year survival rate for all 63 patients was 20%, and only 3 patients were alive at 8 years. The 5-year survival rate for patients who completed the treatment plan and received chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery was 43% compared with 20% for those who had chemotherapy and radiation but refused surgery. Development of a second primary cancer was the cause of death in 62% of the patients who survived more than 24 months. "
neoplasms,"Fibromatous epulis in dogs and peripheral odontogenic fibroma in human beings: two equivalent lesions. This article compares the clinical and histopathologic features of the peripheral odontogenic fibroma in human beings and the fibromatous epulis in dogs. They are apparently equivalent lesions. Both are odontogenic tumors of limited growth potential that do not recur if adequately excised; both occur in middle and late adulthood of the species concerned. The one difference is that the peripheral odontogenic fibroma is a rare condition, whereas the canine fibromatous epulis is common. "
neoplasms,"Treatment of anovulation due to polycystic ovarian syndrome by laparoscopic ovarian electrocautery. Our experience of ovarian electrocautery for the treatment of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in ten women is described. We found that nine responded favourably, either ovulating spontaneously or becoming more responsive to ovulation induction. There was a significant and persistent fall in serum testosterone levels, and a transient fall with subsequent rise in inhibin. We recommend that laparoscopic ovarian electrocautery is considered as an alternative to ovulation induction with gonadotrophins, in women with PCOS who fail to respond to clomiphene citrate. "
neoplasms,"Single polypoid cystitis cystica and glandularis presenting as benign bladder tumor. A case report of a ten-year-old boy with a benign polypoid bladder tumor is presented. The rarity of benign or malignant bladder tumors in children is reviewed, as well as the possible etiology of this unique lesion. "
neoplasms,"Recurrent renal cell carcinoma arising in Wilms' tumor. A 19-month-old black girl had a radical nephrectomy for a Wilms' tumor that contained areas of epithelium indistinguishable from renal cell carcinoma. She was treated with chemotherapy but subsequently had pulmonary metastases develop and massive abdominal recurrence. The recurrent tumor was histologically renal cell carcinoma with no identifiable Wilms' tumor elements. The child died with recurrent and metastatic tumor 13 months after nephrectomy. Pathologic, immunoperoxidase, and flow cytometric studies of this unusual case are presented. "
neoplasms,Pituitary hemorrhage into a Rathke's cleft cyst This report describes a case of symptomatic pituitary hemorrhage into a Rathke's cleft cyst in a 25-year-old woman. The literature on pituitary hemorrhage in nonadenomatous sellar tumors is reviewed. 
neoplasms,"Reconstructions after resections of tumors involving the proximal femur. Advances in prosthesis design, the use of allografts, and a systematic approach to the staging and surgical treatment of musculoskeletal tumors have made limb salvage possible in the proximal femoral region. With the use of effective adjuvant therapy, limb salvage is now an option for the majority of patients presenting with locally invasive neoplasms in this area. The increase in functional outcome is sufficient to warrant serious consideration of limb salvage over the corresponding amputation. Preoperative planning is discussed along with surgical techniques. "
neoplasms,"Malignant melanoma and pigmented lesions: a diagnostic and management dilemma. We document two cases of malignancy occurring at the site of partially removed benign nevi. Because of the difficulty in clinical diagnosis and the uncertainty in its behavior, we propose that any recurring melanocytic nevus expanding beyond the original surgical scar be re-excised and the specimen carefully analyzed to ensure complete removal. "
neoplasms,"Skull base malignancy following long-term sinus mucocele and osteomyelitis. A case of skull base malignancy following long-term sinus mucocele is presented. While the similarity in clinical signs between sinus mucocele and malignancy has recently been emphasized in the literature, no previous case of skull base malignancy following frontoethmoid mucocele has been reported. The literature is reviewed and the association between inflammatory conditions and sinus malignancy is outlined. "
neoplasms,"A multifocal schwannoma of the masseteric nerve causing hemicrania. A case is reported of schwannoma of the right masseteric nerve, invading the pterygopalatine fossa and the parapharyngeal space through the mandibular notch in a 61-year-old woman. The tumor in this case was composed of four various-sized interconnected nodules, simulating a string of beads. The tumor was the cause of the patient's chronic hemicrania, as confirmed by the relief from and disappearance of head pain after surgical removal of the tumor. The most important aspects of this case are the anatomic site of the schwannoma and its uncommon clinicopathologic manifestations; this tumor originated from the masseteric nerve and is the first case reported to straddle the mandibular notch. "
neoplasms,"Desmoplastic variant of ameloblastoma: report of a case and review of the literature. A case of desmoplastic variant of ameloblastoma is reported. The lesion, in a 36-year-old Japanese woman, was successfully treated by partial maxillectomy. Reconstruction was carried out with a block of hydroxyapatite about 7 years and 6 months later. Six cases, including our case, reported up to the present are summarized and reviewed. "
neoplasms,Cell-to-cell communication and the control of growth. Growth of transformed cells is inhibited by cell-to-cell communication with normal cells. This communication is regulated by certain oncogenes that alone or in cooperation can block the communication. 
neoplasms,"Ureteral stump carcinoma incidentally found at cystectomy for bladder cancer. We report on a sixty-five-year-old man with hematuria secondary to superficial bladder cancer. Because of previous urethral trauma, a complete transurethral resection of his bladder tumor could not be done. He, therefore, underwent cystectomy, at which time we incidentally found a transitional cell carcinoma of the left ureteral stump that had been left from a previous left nephrectomy for a World War II-related injury. This case underscores the importance of a thorough investigation of the complete urinary tract in a patient with hematuria or other urinary tract symptoms even if an obvious cause is found for his symptoms. "
neoplasms,"Thyroid cancer. There have been important recent advances in our understanding of the biologic nature of thyroid cancer and in the early diagnosis of the disease. Despite these advances, there is still considerable controversy over the management of thyroid cancer, including the extent of surgery, the indications for the use of iodine-131, the effectiveness of thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression, and the prediction of outcome. In this review, the current status of the diagnosis and management of the various types of thyroid cancer are carefully reviewed and extensively documented. "
neoplasms,"Is urethral sparing at cystectomy a safe procedure? Urethrectomy is performed with cystectomy when the neoplasm is multifocal, at the bladder neck, or associated with carcinoma in situ (CIS). The records of the most recent 20 patients treated by radical cystectomy at our institution were reviewed. In 50 percent of the cases, the extent of disease within the bladder was found to have been underestimated to the point that a urethral sparing operation (i.e., to maintain urinary continence with an intestinal segment and an intact urethra) might have been dangerous. "
neoplasms,"Why patients delay seeking care for cancer symptoms. What you can do about it. Patient delay in seeking care for cancer symptoms is common and well documented by research studies. Fear and denial, lack of information about cancer, and financial considerations all contribute to this delay. Patient education may be an important factor in decreasing the length of delay and thereby improving treatment outcome. By making good use of opportunities for patient education, primary care physicians may positively influence the prognosis of several types of cancer, particularly breast cancer and malignant melanoma of the skin. "
neoplasms,"Subdural hematoma associated with metastatic neoplasms. Two cases of subdural hematoma, one acute and the other chronic, associated with cancer metastatic to the dura are reported. Various mechanisms of the association of hematomas with cancer are reviewed. "
neoplasms,Pulmonary hypertension five years after left pneumonectomy for adenoid cystic carcinoma. We report the findings in a patient with shortness of breath due to pulmonary hypertension five years after left pneumonectomy. Mediastinal recurrence of an incompletely resected and slowly growing adenoid cystic carcinoma of the left main bronchus had encased the right main pulmonary artery. 
neoplasms,"Lesions that manifest as medial cheek and nasolabial fold masses. Seventeen cases were collected in which the patient presented with a medial cheek or nasolabial fold mass. Most of these lesions were uncommon, and some were rare. The most reliable differentiating finding was the type of associated bone involvement. The malignancies had bone erosion and as a group could be distinguished from the other masses. Computed tomographic attenuation and magnetic resonance imaging signal intensities were nonspecific and did not allow a definitive diagnosis to be made. The types of pathologic conditions and their sectional imaging findings are reviewed. "
neoplasms,"Tanning salons: an area survey of proprietors' knowledge of risks and precautions. An area survey of tanning salon proprietors was conducted in a medium-sized midwestern city. Proprietors reported they were in compliance with federal safety regulations, but not all had age, frequency, or duration restrictions. Similarly, proprietors were not uniformly informing patrons of potential tanning hazards, including the possibility of skin cancer, and were not knowledgeable about the risk and benefits of tanning. Some establishments reported selling psoralens to patrons to enhance tanning. More explicit guidelines regarding the use of tanning equipment and more accurate consumer information are needed. "
neoplasms,"Introducing the 'walk-up' flap. Reconstructive oral and maxillofacial surgeons often find the need for additional soft tissue even when a myocutaneous flap has been previously placed. This article introduces the principles, technique, and results of 32 ""walk-up"" muscle flaps derived from existing myocutaneous flaps. The anastomotic vascular ingrowth at the original myocutaneous flap's distal end permits its proximal detachment and axial vessel ligation to rotate the proximal two thirds to a tissue-deficient site. In our experience at the University of Miami, these flaps have been predictable (97% viable transfer rate), have provided vascular soft tissue in deficient areas, and have been skin grafted at their surface to increase oral lining or skin cover, among several other uses. "
neoplasms,"Pharyngeal adenocarcinoma with intestinal features. A high grade adenocarcinoma arising primarily in the pharynx of a 67-year-old man is presented. A CT-scan revealed a tumour mass growing in the pharynx, largely affecting parapharyngeal soft tissues. Lymph node metastases were found at clinical presentation. Both morphological and immunohistochemical studies displayed similar features to those of intestinal origin. To our knowledge, no previous examples of such neoplasm have been reported at this site. Its possible histogenetical origin is discussed. "
neoplasms,Oral manifestations of HIV infection and their management. II. Less common lesions. This second of two articles reviews the many uncommon and rare oral lesions that have arisen in persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The various drug-related oral disorders of HIV disease are also considered. 
neoplasms,"Hemangiopericytoma of the sternum. Hemangiopericytoma of the chest wall is a rare tumor. We describe a patient with malignant hemangiopericytoma of the sternum who was treated with primary surgical resection and discuss the clinical, radiographic, and histologic features of the case. Surgical resection is the primary mode of therapy. High-dose radiotherapy and chemotherapy with a doxorubicin hydrochloride-containing combination may be warranted in certain cases. "
neoplasms,"Non-Hodgkins lymphoma of the head and neck: experience in the Grampian area. The records of 44 cases of non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) presenting to the ear, nose and throat department in the Grampian area from 1980-1988 were examined in relation to site of occurrence, histology, age at presentation, clinical stage, treatment and survival. The median age was 67 years and there was a preponderance of high grade histology, especially in disease affecting the tonsil. Most deaths occurred in the first year; patients with high grade disease and those in stages three and four had a significantly poorer survival during the first year. The site of disease had no influence on survival. "
neoplasms,"Bone marrow necrosis in leukemic-phase follicular lymphoma. Bone marrow necrosis has been regarded as a rare entity in specimens obtained from living patients and has been associated with a poor prognosis. It is most commonly found in patients with neoplastic disorders, severe infections, and sickle cell anemia. We present an unusual case of a small-cleaved type follicular lymphoma associated with bone marrow necrosis and a leukemic phase occurring in a 55-year-old woman. Specimens were studied by morphologic, immunohistochemical, cytogenetic, and DNA hybridization techniques. "
neoplasms,Late development of a squamous carcinoma in a reconstructed pharynx. We report a case in which a squamous cell carcinoma was found to have arisen from a delto-pectoral skin flap used in pharyngeal reconstruction. The flap had been forming a neo-pharynx for 24 years. No other signs of recurrent disease had developed in this period. This raises the possibility of tumour induction in heterotopic skin used for oropharyngeal reconstruction. 
neoplasms,"The World Health Organization's histologic classification of gastrointestinal tumors. A commentary on the second edition. The World Health Organization's (WHO) histologic classification of gastrointestinal tumors has been revised. Although the general basis of classification and the overall outline remain similar to the first edition, advances in the last decade justified changes in classifying certain entities; among them were malignant lymphomas, endocrine tumors, and dysplasias. Several newly recognized entities have also been added. "
neoplasms,"Pneumonia due to Legionella micdadei in bone marrow transplant recipients. Legionella micdadei has previously been described as a cause of nosocomial pneumonia, particularly in kidney transplant recipients. Cell-mediated immunity is the principal host defense against this pathogen. A common clinical scenario in the immunocompromised host is that of septic pulmonary embolus, but asymptomatic infections have also been reported. The organism is weakly acid-fast in clinical specimens but loses this property when grown on solid media. We report two cases of L. micdadei pneumonia, differing markedly in clinical severity and outcome, in bone marrow transplant recipients. Additionally, we note the growth of the organism in liquid culture media with preservation of its acid-fast property. "
neoplasms,"Myofibroblastoma of the tongue. An immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and flow cytometric study. A case of myofibroblastoma arising in the tongue of a 77-year-old man is described. The patient presented with a submucosal tongue mass without other associated symptoms. The tumor was 2 cm in diameter, well circumscribed, and composed of uniform spindle cells arranged in fascicles. Electron microscopic examination and immunohistochemistry demonstrated a myofibroblastic origin for the tumor cells. DNA flow cytometric analysis showed a diploid DNA content of this tumor. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of myofibroblastoma occurring in the tongue. "
neoplasms,Surgical management of pulmonary metastatic leiomyosarcoma with gross endobronchial extension. Metastatic leiomyosarcoma occasionally is seen with gross endobronchial extension without invasion of the bronchial wall. These patients have major airway obstruction and partial or total atelectasis of the lung. Precise bronchoscopic assessment coupled with intraoperative bronchotomy allows the surgeon to determine the origin of the tumor and to save uninvolved pulmonary parenchyma. Our experience with 4 such patients illustrates the possibility of saving lung tissue despite total bronchial obstruction. 
neoplasms,"Surgical approach to the retrocrural lymph nodes. Removal of retrocrural lymph nodes requires an approach other than the infradiaphragmatic retroperitoneal access generally used in the surgical management of testicular tumours. The transperitoneal route given access, at best, to the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, but advanced testicular tumours occasionally require retrocrural node dissection. We describe a useful surgical approach to these nodes and the underlying anatomy. "
neoplasms,"Terminal duct adenocarcinomas of salivary tissues. Terminal duct adenocarcinoma is recommended as an encompassing diagnostic designation for a preponderantly intraoral salivary gland carcinoma that has also gone under the names of polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma, lobular carcinoma, and low-grade papillary adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma is biologically low grade, with its papillary phenotype manifesting a more aggressive behavior than nonpapillary forms. "
neoplasms,Multiple granular cell tumors associated with giant speckled lentiginous nevus and nevus flammeus in a child. We describe an 11-year-old girl in whom multiple cutaneous granular cell tumors were associated with a giant speckled lentiginous nevus and an extensive nevus flammeus. An association between granular cell tumors and pigmented skin lesions has been reported twice previously and supports a neural origin for these tumors. An abnormality of neural crest development is proposed to explain the coexistence of three uncommon and unusually extensive cutaneous disorders in this patient. This case may represent a further variant of phakomatosis pigmentovascularis. 
neoplasms,Capillary haemangioma presenting as a lung pseudocyst. A girl who developed a lung cyst at 24 hours of age during gentle ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome is reported. Instead of resolving as expected of a pseudocyst it continued to expand. Resection at 1 year of age showed a cyst entirely surrounded by capillary haemangioma. Aspiration of this cyst would have been dangerous. 
neoplasms,Congenital abnormalities of the lymphatic system: a new clinical classification. The numerous clinical presentations of congenital abnormalities of the lymphatic system in children and the confusing terminology used to describe their pathologic diagnoses impede the physician's understanding of the condition. The clinical classification based on the actual symptoms of the congenital problems we have presented here should help the physician identify the specific abnormality and a potential treatment. Future research should concentrate on the specific causes and the treatment of these congenital abnormalities. 
neoplasms,"High cardiac output as a paraneoplastic syndrome. A high cardiac output (17 1 min-1) was recorded in a young man suffering from lymphoplasmatocytotic lymphoma. The evolution of the blood disease was characterized by two relapses, during which clinical signs of heart failure were prominent but resolved with efficient blood chemotherapy. The known aetiologies of high cardiac output were excluded. The complete normalization of the cardiac parameters with blood remission suggests that the high cardiac output represented an unusual paraneoplastic syndrome, the pathogenesis of which still remains unknown, although several hypotheses were tested. "
neoplasms,Posterior mediastinal teratoma with abdominal extension. Posterior mediastinal benign teratomas are uncommon neoplasms in infancy; nine cases have been reported so far. A one month old baby was found to have a benign posterior mediastinal teratoma infiltrating the lower oesophagus from the level of the carina through the oesophageal hiatus into the upper abdomen. Partial oesophagectomy provided a successful outcome. 
neoplasms,"Modified anterior compartment resection. In the majority of patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the anterior compartment of the thigh, it is possible to preserve a small portion of the quadriceps with intact nerve supply without compromising on the radicality of the procedure or the local control rate. The distal one-third of the vastus medialis can usually be spared with a long, slender branch providing its innervation. Dissection of the femoral nerve below the inguinal ligament and its branch(es) to an uninvolved area of the quadricepts the farthest from the location of the tumor is essential. This modified anterior compartment resection improves dramatically the function of the extremity. "
neoplasms,"Cerebellopontine angle lipoma in a teenager. Lipomas of the cerebellopontine angle are very rare lesions. To date, 18 patients have been reported, 17 of whom were adults. A second child is described with cerebellopontine angle lipoma. "
neoplasms,"Pleuroperitoneal shunting for intractable pleural effusions. Pleuroperitoneal shunts were implanted in 17 patients with intractable pleural effusions, 15 of which were malignant and 2 benign. Complicating factors included 13 instances of severe trapped lung and 3 cases of synchronous ascites. There was one hospital death. Palliation of dyspnea at rest was achieved in all patients, although 3 required oxygen with exertion. Four shunts became occluded between 1 and 10 months after placement. Two of these were replaced. The remaining conduits continued to function to the present or until the patients' deaths between 1 and 28 months. Shunting allowed hospital discharge and provided symptomatic relief in a group of patients in whom other approaches had failed or were not applicable. "
neoplasms,"Pleomorphic (anaplastic) neuroblastoma in nude mice. Two pleomorphic (anaplastic) neuroblastomas, from two children aged 1 and 6 years, were transplanted into nude mice. Two noteworthy observations were made. In one case, the transplanted tumor gave rise to a soft-tissue sarcoma. Moreover, in both cases hepatic metastases were associated with a striking modification of murine hepatocytes, resulting in hyperchromatic and dysplastic nuclei. The latter finding was particularly evident in the hepatic areas surrounding all metastases of pleomorphic (anaplastic) neuroblastoma cells. "
neoplasms,"Uneventful delivery following series of successive treatments for virilized Cushing syndrome due to adrenocortical carcinoma. A twenty-one-year-old virilized woman with Cushing syndrome due to a huge adrenocortical carcinoma was successively treated with trilostane (3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor), subsequent adrenalectomy, and postoperative cis-platinum. Clinical or biochemical abnormalities peculiar to Cushing syndrome gradually subsided, and three and one-half years after the adrenal surgery, the patient delivered a normal female infant. This study points out some of the clinical and biochemical responses of each treatment. "
neoplasms,"Inflammatory pseudosarcoma (pseudotumor) of the bladder. Inflammatory pseudosarcoma of the bladder is a rare benign entity that cannot be differentiated from malignant tumor at radiologic examination alone. Only pathologic examination can enable a definitive diagnosis. The authors report two cases of these benign tumors in patients with no history of bladder disease or trauma; the tumors were large, demonstrated invasion into local tissues, and recurred in one case after incomplete transurethral resection. "
neoplasms,Misdiagnosis of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome due to hyperlipidemia. Most authorities feel that diagnosis of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is established when the serum gastrin level is greater than 1000 pg/mL (1000 ng/L) in a patient with gastric acid hypersecretion and clinical manifestations consistent with the diagnosis. A patient with recurrent peptic ulcer disease is reported who was thought to have had the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome based on two serum gastrin level measurements greater than 1000 pg/mL (1000 ng/L). Subsequent evaluation revealed the gastrin elevation to be spurious because the sample was hyperlipidemic. Lipemic serum samples may yield falsely elevated serum gastrin determinations as determined by radioimmunoassay. 
neoplasms,Suddenly symptomatic brain tumors at altitude. High-altitude cerebral edema can present with a wide variety of neurologic manifestations; these symptoms resolve with descent. The persistence of neurologic symptoms after descent suggests an intracranial lesion. Brain tumors suddenly becoming symptomatic at altitude have not been reported previously. We report three cases of previously unsuspected brain tumors that suddenly became symptomatic at high altitudes. 
neoplasms,"Ovarian neoplasms and the risk of adnexal torsion. Previous reports examining adnexal torsion suggested that benign ovarian neoplasms are more likely to undergo torsion than malignant ovarian neoplasms. To our knowledge, this clinical observation has not been quantified. To examine this hypothesis, we reviewed our experience with ovarian neoplasms found at the time of surgery over a 10-year period. Benign ovarian neoplasms had a 12.9-fold increased risk of undergoing adnexal torsion when compared with malignant ovarian neoplasms (95% confidence interval, 10.2 to 15.9). The histologic type of ovarian neoplasm does not appear to affect the rate of adnexal torsion. Adnexal torsion rarely involves cancer. "
neoplasms,"DNA analysis of neoplasia: an introduction for the family physician. Pathologic evaluation of a neoplastic process has traditionally consisted of microscopic examination of a stained section of tissue. Although this method is generally reliable when performed by an experienced pathologist, the morphologic features of a lesion may not consistently predict biologic behavior. The DNA content of tumors can be studied with a flow cytometer to help determine the prognosis and risk of tumor recurrence. DNA analysis of a neoplasm may provide the clinician with important prognostic information and, at some future date, may help direct chemotherapy or other treatment protocols. "
neoplasms,"Fourth ventricular schwannoma. Case report. A schwannoma arising from the dorsum of the pontomedullary junction and presenting as an exophytic mass in the fourth ventricle is described. A ventricular schwannoma has not previously been reported in the literature. The presenting clinical and radiographic features and the pathology of this tumor are summarized, and an explanation is sought for its unusual location. "
neoplasms,"Carbon dioxide laser vaporization of diaphragmatic metastases for cytoreduction of ovarian epithelial cancer. Three patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics state IIIC ovarian adenocarcinoma underwent CO2 laser vaporization of large-volume (5-6 cm) and miliary right hemidiaphragmatic metastases at the conclusion of standard debulking surgery to effect optimal cytoreduction. Destruction of diaphragmatic metastases was accomplished rapidly with no added morbidity or blood loss. The hand-held CO2 laser is a useful modality for removal of isolated large- and small-volume diaphragmatic disease, particularly if only the peritoneum is involved, and avoids the morbidity that may accompany entry into the pleural space. "
neoplasms,Localization of trophoblastic disease with vaginal ultrasonography. A report of two cases. Two patients had elevated beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels and normal abdominal ultrasound examinations. In both instances transvaginal ultrasonography demonstrated a persistent nodule of trophoblastic disease confirmed at the time of hysterectomy. This new imaging modality can assist in the diagnosis of persistent trophoblastic disease in the uterus. 
neoplasms,"Pheochromocytoma and acute myocardial infarction. When a pheochromocytoma is manifested as an acute myocardial illness, diagnosis may be difficult to make. If the tumor is suspected early enough, a workup can be done while the complications of the myocardial illness are being controlled (as in our case). The tumor can then be expeditiously removed before any further problems develop. The case presented here underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for a pheochromocytoma in any patient who has an unexpected myocardial event. "
neoplasms,Successful conservative management of primary nonmetastatic cervical choriocarcinoma. Primary cervical choriocarcinoma is a rare disease; since 1915 only about 60 cases have been published. The case presented here can be defined as primary cervical choriocarcinoma since it fulfills all the criteria delineated previously. 
neoplasms,"Oculo-bulbar myasthenic symptoms as the sole sign of tumour involving or compressing the brain stem. Four patients with tumours involving or compressing the brain stem are described whose initial clinical symptoms of fluctuating paresis of the external ocular muscles and/or the pharyngeal muscles without other neurological deficits led to the primary diagnosis of focal myasthenia. The combination of an unusual clinical pattern, involvement of muscles of only one ocular nerve or severe dysphagia/dysarthria without extension of the myasthenic symptoms, should lead to further investigation to exclude other reasons of a focal myasthenic syndrome such as a brain-stem tumour. "
neoplasms,"Fine-needle aspiration for diagnosis of intranodal squamous-cell carcinoma metastatic from the skin. Fine-needle aspiration is a useful way to determine the presence of squamous-cell carcinoma in enlarged lymph nodes of patients at high risk for metastases. Advantages include a high degree of accuracy, outpatient as well as inpatient availability, and negligible potential for seeding of malignant cells. Cutaneous oncologists should consider using this technique in patients with lymphadenopathy and a previous history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. "
neoplasms,"Pelvic resections: the Rizzoli Institute experience. Materials, methods, and techniques of pelvic resections are discussed. Results, including the complications of nerve damage, infection, and vascular, visceral, and reconstructive complications are tabulated. "
neoplasms,"Isolated primary aldosteronism in a patient with adrenal carcinoma and XY/XXY mosaic Klinefelter's syndrome. Although breast cancer, germ cell tumors and other neoplasms are known to occur in patients with Klinefelter's syndrome, adrenal carcinoma has not yet been reported in such patients. We describe a rare case of severe primary aldosteronism as the unique manifestation of a large adrenocortical carcinoma in a patient with Klinefelter's syndrome. Complete biological and hormonal evaluation was performed. Surgical treatment was successful and the patient remained asymptomatic with normal biological and hormonal values after 1 year of followup. "
neoplasms,"Aetiology of pancreatic cancer Curative surgery is possible in only a small minority of patients with pancreatic cancer and, to date, responses to chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been disappointing. To make any impact on the incidence of the disease a clearer understanding of its aetiology is required. This review explores present knowledge of the aetiology and epidemiology of pancreatic cancer. "
neoplasms,Imaging of adult central nervous system primary malignant gliomas. Staging and follow-up. A classification and staging system for primary adult gliomas was proposed. This system uses the high signal intensity found on proton density or T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) scans at the site of the tumor and surrounding edema (including infiltrating tumor). 
neoplasms,"Limbal autograft reconstruction after conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma. Two patients who had squamous cell carcinoma with extensive limbal and corneal involvement were treated with surgery and cryotherapy. Rarely large areas of the cornea are involved by this tumor. Visual prognosis in such patients is poor. In these two patients, autologous limbal transplants were effective in restoring an excellent corneal surface and good visual function. This technique may be useful in the reconstruction of eyes with extensive neoplastic involvement of the corneoscleral limbus and cornea. "
neoplasms,"Left ventricular fibroma: echocardiographic diagnosis and successful surgical excision in three cases. The management of three patients with left ventricular fibromas is outlined. All were asymptomatic children. Routine chest radiography suggested cardiac masses. M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography were valuable adjuncts to conventional angiography in assessing these children. Electrocardiographic changes, present in all cases, were shown to regress postoperatively. We stress the importance of these noninvasive aids in the initial investigation and outline our operative methods of reconstruction. "
neoplasms,"Strabismus caused by melanoma metastatic to an extraocular muscle. Nonocular melanoma rarely metastasizes to the orbit. We report the case of a melanoma presumably arising from an axillary lymph node sinus that metastasized to the left medial rectus muscle causing proptosis, diplopia, and reduced saccadic velocity measurements. Clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic data are presented and discussed. "
neoplasms,"Neurinoma in the cavernous sinus: report of two cases. Two cases of trigeminal neurinoma located solely in the cavernous sinus are reported. Preoperatively, magnetic resonance imaging provided the accurate localization of the lesions, allowing precise planning of the surgical approach, that is, a subtemporal lateral approach and a pterional superior approach, respectively. The neurinomas inside the cavernous sinus were removed successfully, and the patients developed no new neurological deficits except for anesthesia in the 1st division of the trigeminal nerve. The characteristic magnetic resonance imaging findings of trigeminal neurinoma in the cavernous sinus are presented, and the different surgical approaches are discussed. "
neoplasms,"Endodermal sinus tumor of the ovary during pregnancy: a case report. Serum alpha-fetoprotein screening led to the detection of an endodermal sinus tumor of the ovary in a 24-year-old female in week 17 of pregnancy. After surgery, chemotherapy was postponed. In week 28 levels of serum alpha-fetoprotein increased, but delivery was delayed until 33 weeks' gestation. After delivery, the patient received four chemotherapy courses (cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin). Mother (24 months after last chemotherapy) and child are doing well. "
neoplasms,"Nitrite from inflammatory cells--a cancer risk factor in ulcerative colitis? Elevated levels of luminal nitrite and a lowered luminal pH were found in 77 percent of patients with acute ulcerative colitis. No luminal nitrite was found in healthy control subjects. Nitrites are a secretory product of activated macrophages and neutrophils of the lamina propria, whereas the lowered luminal pH is due to diminished bicarbonate formation by impaired colonocytes. A hypothesis is put forward that nitrites, lowered pH, and bacterial amines are conducive to formation of carcinogenic n-nitroso compounds, which reflect a cancer risk in patients with ulcerative colitis dependent on the type and extent of inflammatory cell activation as well as metabolic impairment of colonic epithelial cells. "
neoplasms,Pregnancy associated with Gorlin's syndrome. A pregnant woman with Gorlin's syndrome presented for the removal of malignant ovarian tumours. The main problem encountered by the anaesthetists was an unexpected increase in arterial blood pressure. This was most probably associated with surgical manipulation of the ovaries with an increase in prorenin/renin production. 
neoplasms,"Congenital tracheoesophageal fistula associated with carcinoma of the lung in an adult. A rare case of adult congenital H-type tracheoesophageal fistula was diagnosed. Subsequently, at operation, large cell, undifferentiated carcinoma of the right middle lobe with extension to the right lobe and adherence to the diaphragm was documented. The diagnosis, surgical intervention, and 4-year follow-up are presented. "
neoplasms,"Spontaneous regression in Merkel cell (neuroendocrine) carcinoma of the skin. In two Japanese women, 68 and 88 years old, Merkel cell (neuroendocrine) carcinoma of the face developed. Their tumors regressed after biopsy was performed, a rare occurrence. Histological and electron microscopic examination showed apoptosis, cellular necrosis, and an infiltration composed mainly of lymphocytes in the tumors. These changes may have been related to the mechanism of regression. It is interesting that our two patients were women, as was another patient described with Merkel cell carcinoma regression, in light of the fact that the prognosis of this tumor is sex dependent. "
neoplasms,"Continuity of cancer care. The importance of providing continuity in the care of all patients with major medical problems, such as cancer, has widespread acceptance in our current health care system. From the perspective of an oncology social work clinician, this article offers a definition of the concept of continuity of care, examines factors influencing its provision in oncology, and reviews key components in continuity of cancer care planning and implementation. It also examines some innovative efforts in practice to improve continuity. "
neoplasms,"Diffuse hemangiomatosis of the spleen: splenic hemangiomatosis presenting with giant splenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. In an elderly patient with oligosymptomatic giant splenomegaly, clinical and laboratory data were nondiagnostic, while nonhomogeneous splenic enlargement was the only finding detected by imaging procedures. Splenectomy was performed and diffuse hemangiomatosis of predominantly capillary-type found. The failure of imaging techniques to even hint at the nature of the underlying disorder is comprehensible in view of the organ being essentially replaced in toto by the abnormal vascular channels. Diffuse splenic hemangiomatosis, a rare condition, may cause hypersplenism, and its diagnosis may be elusive because of misleading patterns on imaging. "
neoplasms,Adenomatous polyp of the fallopian tube. A case report. Benign epithelial lesions of the fallopian tube are rare. An adenomatous polyp of the fallopian tube was discovered incidentally at laparotomy. 
neoplasms,"Synchronous diffuse well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma and gastric adenocarcinoma presenting as splenomegaly and iron deficiency anemia. Diffuse well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma (D-WDLL) and chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) represent closely related neoplasms which may have indolent courses. Dating back more than one century, reports of associated second primary malignancies continue to intrigue clinicians. A case of synchronous D-WDLL and gastric adenocarcinoma, presenting as splenomegaly and iron deficiency anemia, is presented. The case and literature are reviewed. "
neoplasms,"Brain and spinal cord hemorrhage in long-term survivors of malignant pediatric brain tumors: a possible late effect of therapy. Three children with malignant primary CNS tumors treated with craniospinal radiotherapy developed intraparenchymal hemorrhages a median of 5 years following therapy in sites distant from the primary tumor. Radical surgical procedures disclosed fresh and old hematoma, gliosis, and necrosis in all 3 patients and an aggregation of abnormal microscopic blood vessels in two. No tumor was found. All 3 patients remain in long-term (greater than 10 years) continuous remission. "
neoplasms,Femoral mononeuropathy after radical prostatectomy. Femoral mononeuropathy is a recognized complication following abdominal and vaginal hysterectomy. Retractor injury and lithotomy position were postulated mechanisms. We report a femoral nerve lesion following a radical perineal prostatectomy. 
neoplasms,"Caseating hepatic granulomas in Hodgkin's lymphoma. A 68-year-old man presented with recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma after a 9-year disease-free interval induced by chemotherapy. In addition to histological evidence of recurrent Hodgkin's disease, the liver biopsy specimen showed extensive caseating granulomas. Cultures of bone marrow and liver tissue tested negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. No antituberculous treatment was administered, and the patient had an excellent clinical response to additional chemotherapy for lymphoma. Hodgkin's lymphoma should be added to the list of disease entities associated with caseating granulomas in the liver. "
neoplasms,"Bowenoid papulosis. Bowenoid papulosis is an uncommon genital dysplasia induced by human papillomavirus infection. Clinically, it usually resembles persistent warts, but histologically it may be suggestive of squamous cell carcinoma in situ. This unusual disorder and recent advances in our understanding of it are reviewed. "
neoplasms,"Oxygen-exacerbated bleomycin pulmonary toxicity Bleomycin is an antineoplastic agent with potential for producing pulmonary toxicity, attributed in part to its free radical-promoting ability. Clinical and research experiences have suggested that the risk of bleomycin-induced pulmonary injury is increased with the administration of oxygen. We report a case in which the intraoperative administration of oxygen in the setting of previous bleomycin therapy contributed to postoperative ventilatory failure. Our patient recovered with corticosteroid therapy. Physician awareness of a potential interaction between oxygen and bleomycin may help reduce the morbidity and mortality related to bleomycin therapy. "
neoplasms,"Clear cell carcinoma of the inguinal region arising from endometriosis. The second and third examples of clear cell carcinoma of the inguinal region arising from endometriosis are reported. In one patient a right inguinal mass was excised along with an inguinal lymph node dissection. The tumor recurred in the retroperitoneum and was removed, and postoperative radiation therapy was administered. The patient died of recurrent tumor after 11 years. The other patient was treated by excision of a left inguinal mass and an inguinal lymph node dissection and was alive without recurrence 4 years and 8 months later. "
neoplasms,"Adenocarcinoma of the appendiceal stump. We have reported the case of a 58-year-old woman with nonspecific abdominal complaints in whom barium enema and subsequent colonoscopy showed a 3 cm lobulated adenocarcinoma within a villous adenoma arising from the appendiceal stump. Because such appendiceal malignancies have no specific clinical signs, symptoms, or radiologic features, preoperative diagnosis is extremely difficult, and colonoscopy may be required to clarify radiologically demonstrated irregularities. "
neoplasms,Bilateral malignant phyllodes tumours. We report a rare example of bilateral primary malignant phyllodes tumours. The diagnosis was supported by the identification of a benign epithelial element in each lesion. The case illustrates the typical dimorphic features of malignant phyllodes tumours. A contralateral tumour should not be regarded as metastatic without histological confirmation. 
neoplasms,"Bronchial anomaly of the right upper lobe. This case report presents a rare anomaly of right upper lobe bronchial anatomy. During routine right upper lobe resection for carcinoma, a common right upper and middle lobe bronchus was found. The resection was completed as a right upper and middle bilobectomy. Knowledge of this uncommon variant was beneficial in performing the pulmonary resection. A review of the literature is presented. "
neoplasms,"Invasive squamous cell carcinoma in a patient with epidermodysplasia verruciformis. A patient with epidermodysplasia verruciformis died of intracranial invasion by squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A biopsy of clinically normal skin had revealed perineural invasion by malignant keratinocytes. Because SCCs arising in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis may be biologically aggressive, it is best to excise them with careful control of the surgical tissue margins. "
neoplasms,"Extramedullary plasmacytoma of the urethra: a case report. Extramedullary plasmacytomas are uncommon manifestations of plasma cell neoplasms, which occur rarely in the urinary tract. We report to our knowledge the third case of primary IgA plasmacytoma of the urethra. Diagnosis, therapy and followup with magnetic resonance imaging are presented. "
neoplasms,"Spinal extradural cavernous hemangioma. Three cases of isolated spinal extradural cavernous hemangiomas are reported, two in the thoracic and one in the lumbar region. One of them manifested as acute cord compression, the other two as chronic progressive myelopathy or radiculopathy. A total excision or subtotal excision with irradiation was performed. All of them had good functional recovery. The clinical picture, radiological diagnosis, and optimal method of treatment are discussed. The relevant literature is reviewed. "
neoplasms,"Donor leukocyte transfusions for treatment of recurrent chronic myelogenous leukemia in marrow transplant patients. Three patients with hematologic relapse after bone marrow transplantation for chronic myelogenous leukemia were treated with interferon alpha and transfusion of viable donor buffy coat. All had complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission, which persisted 32 to 91 weeks after treatment. In two patients graft-versus-host disease developed and was treated by immunosuppression. These results are an example of adoptive immunotherapy without cytoreductive chemotherapy or radiotherapy in human chimeras. "
neoplasms,Factor XIIIa in nodular malignant melanoma and Spitz naevi. The distribution of factor XIIIa-positive dermal dendritic cells was studied in a series of nodular malignant melanomas and compared with that seen in Spitz naevi. Two patterns of distribution were recognizable: (a) diffusely spread through the tumour and (b) located mainly at the periphery of the tumour. These did not correlate with the diagnosis of melanoma or Spitz naevus and the distribution appeared to be a function of growth pattern of the tumour. The diffuse pattern was the most common regardless of diagnosis and the distribution of factor XIIIa-positive cells is the same in malignant melanoma and Spitz naevi. 
neoplasms,"Breast cancer: the military's experience at Wilford Hall USAF Medical Center. We reviewed the experience with breast cancer at Wilford Hall USAF Medical Center for the years 1978 through 1988. A total of 868 cases were identified in the Wilford Hall Tumor Registry; overall 5-year and 10-year survivals were 63% and 39%, respectively. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma represented the principal histologic category. The other predominant variants included invasive lobular carcinoma, lobular carcinoma in situ, and ductal carcinoma in situ. Until recently, most of these patients (90%) had modified radical mastectomy as their definitive surgical therapy, with chemotherapy reserved primarily for patients with advanced disease. "
neoplasms,"A recurrent pelvic desmoid tumor successfully treated with tamoxifen. A case of recurrent retroperitoneal desmoid tumor successfully treated with tamoxifen (Nolvadex tablets, ICI Pharma, Division of ICI Americas, Wilmington, DE) is reported. The patient presented late in her second pregnancy with a large retroperitoneal pelvic desmoid tumor that was treated with surgical excision and megestrol acetate. When the tumor recurred 12 months later, it was again treated with surgery, this time followed by radiation therapy. The desmoid tumor quickly recurred. The patient was then treated with tamoxifen, resulting in a complete tumor regression that has remained stable for 27 months. Tamoxifen should be considered as first-line therapy in recurrent desmoid tumors. "
neoplasms,"Primary non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma of the esophagus. A case with peculiar endoscopic ultrasonographic pattern. We report a case of primary esophageal non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma in a young white female. At admission, endoscopy revealed large, irregularly shaped, esophageal ulcerations with super imposed candidiasis. Endoscopic ultrasonography to assess submucosal alterations and periesophageal involvement revealed a diffuse hypoechogenic thickening (up to 5 mm) of the esophageal wall, a pattern consistent with lymphomatous infiltration. Definitive diagnosis was made with the aid of histology and immunohistochemistry. "
neoplasms,Endometrioma of the liver. Hepatic endometriosis is extremely rare. We describe a patient sent to us with epigastric pain as the only symptom and who was found to have associated endometrioma of the liver and left ovary. We suggest a gynecologic evaluation before surgery for hepatic cyst of unknown cause. 
neoplasms,Role of systemic therapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Increasing evidence supports the investigation of chemotherapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Randomized studies in patients with stage IV disease have shown increased survival in chemotherapy-treated patients compared to best supportive care and indicate the ability of chemotherapy to alter the natural history of this disease. Randomized studies involving adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy have also shown encouraging results. These studies and results of recent pilot studies utilizing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and concomitant chemoradiotherapy indicate a potential benefit from the use of chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC and call for its continued intensive investigation in clinical trials. 
neoplasms,"Gonadoblastoma in an anatomically normal man: a case report and literature review. Gonadoblastoma, a rare gonadal neoplasm, presents most frequently in phenotypic female or phenotypically male patients with dysgenetic gonads or undescended testes. To date, only 2 cases of gonadoblastoma have been reported in anatomically normal male patients with scrotal testes. Both of these patients presented with testicular masses and germ cell tumors. We report a case of a genotypically and phenotypically normal, fertile man with descended testes who on evaluation for chronic orchialgia had a gonadoblastoma unaccompanied by a germ cell neoplasm. The tumor was nonpalpable and was initially discovered on scrotal ultrasound. "
neoplasms,"Hemangioma of the temporalis muscle. A rare case of an intramuscular hemangioma of the temporalis muscle is reported. The clinical examination, carotid arteriogram, computed tomographic scan, and aspiration cytology suggested the vascular nature of the tumor, but an exact diagnosis could only be made after histopathologic examination. Temporary occlusion of the ipsilateral external carotid artery and subperiosteal dissection permitted complete, wide excision without much bleeding. "
neoplasms,"Chylothorax as presenting manifestation of adenocarcinoma with probable gastric primary. Chylothorax is an unusual complication of various malignant neoplasms, generally lymphomas. The few reported cases of chylothorax with gastric and other abdominal malignancies have involved large abdominal masses with prominent adenopathy and chylous ascites. We describe a patient in whom chylothorax was the presenting manifestation of an adenocarcinoma with probable gastric primary, developing prior to any clinical or radiologic evidence of tumor. "
neoplasms,"Tuberous sclerosis. Tuberous sclerosis (epiloia, Bourneville-Pringle syndrome) is an inherited disease with an autosomal pattern. Both sexes are affected equally with varied expression in successive generations. Two cases of this unusual disorder in siblings are reported. They illustrate heredofamilial nature, dissimilar expression, mutations, and oral manifestations. "
neoplasms,"Undifferentiated carcinomas of salivary glands. Undifferentiated carcinomas of salivary glands are those epithelial malignancies whose light-optic histopathologic features are not sufficient to place them in other defined classes of carcinoma. They are ultrastructurally heterogeneous and can manifest neuroendocrine differentiation. With or without the latter, the carcinomas are biologically high-grade and rank with salivary duct and high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas in terms of morbidity and mortality. "
neoplasms,Results of multiple pulmonary resections for metastatic osteogenic sarcoma after two decades. A 20-year follow-up of children who had complete resection of pulmonary metastases from osteogenic sarcoma of the extremities was undertaken. Four of six 10-year survivors survived more than 19 years even with multiple metastases and as many as nine thoracotomies. Fifty percent of the 10-year survivors developed second primary cancers during the second decade of follow-up. 
neoplasms,"Interferon alpha and etretinate combination treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Eleven patients suffering from cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides) were treated with recombinant interferon alpha-2A in combination (seven patients) or alone. Two patients, one in combined treatment, went into clinical complete remission, and five experienced partial remission. Two patients progressed during therapy, and two were nonevaluable because they stopped treatment early due to side effects. Dosages of interferon were from 3 to 36 million units daily for 3 months, and thereafter 3 times weekly. Etretinate (0.7 mg/kg) was given orally. The study showed that recombinant interferon alpha-2A in combination with etretinate or alone can induce remission of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. "
neoplasms,"Significance and treatment of positive margins or seminal vesicle invasion after radical prostatectomy. The periprostatic soft-tissue involvement described in the older urologic literature differs from that now recognized; a much ""earlier"" pathologic stage C is being identified. Apparent microscopic extension of the cancer to the margin of the specimen yields an approximately 25% risk of local recurrence. Postoperative radiation apparently is effective in reducing this risk, and if patients are properly selected, such treatment is well tolerated. Whether adjuvant radiation affects overall survival is not known. New observations on pathologic extension of the disease need to be refined. "
neoplasms,"Modified technique of Pringle's maneuver in resection of the liver. Crushing of the hepatic parenchyma with hepatic clamps to minimize blood loss during resection of the liver leads to mechanical damage of hepatocytes. Pringle's maneuver may precipitate liver failure by hepatic warm ischemia as well. Therefore, we controlled bleeding from the surface of the resection by using light compression on the hepatic parenchyma with a band while applying a hepatic arterial clamp at the hepatic hilus. This vascular control method can be done because the portal pressure is about one-tenth of the hepatic artery pressure and provides an efficient and harmless transection of the liver. "
neoplasms,"Vagal schwannoma. A patient with a benign encapsulated intrathoracic vagal schwannoma is presented and the literature is reviewed. The right paratracheal tumor was identified incidentally on a chest film and excised using a right thoracotomy. Although rare, vagal schwannomas should be considered for any mediastinal mass along the vagus nerves especially when the paratracheal tumor produces minimal or no respiratory symptoms suggesting a slow-growing, encapsulated process. "
neoplasms,Null cell adenoma of the pituitary with features of plurihormonality and plurimorphous differentiation. The case of a 35-year-old man with pituitary macroadenoma who was complaining of reduced sexual activity is presented. Histologic examination showed a chromophobic adenoma corresponding mainly to a null cell adenoma at the ultrastructural level. Focal plurihormonality and plurimorphous differentiation of adenoma cells were demonstrated by immunohistochemical and electron-microscopic studies. It is suggested that adenomatous null cells represent pluripotent progenitor cells capable of transforming to different hormone-producing cell types. The factors accounting for differentiating to various cell populations have yet to be elucidated. 
neoplasms,"When epilepsy masquerades as heart disease. Awareness is key to avoiding misdiagnosis. Autonomic neural impulses that accompany discharges during a seizure can cause a variety of cardiac manifestations, including cardiac arrhythmias, sudden death, anginal chest pain, neurogenic pulmonary edema, and symptoms of pheochromocytoma. Either generalized or focal seizures may generate such signs and symptoms. A better appreciation of cardiac problems caused by epilepsy is helpful in preventing misdiagnosis, because the clinical picture in such a patient may be confusing. "
neoplasms,"Flexible sigmoidoscopy as a screening procedure in rural patients. In this study of flexible sigmoidoscopy as a screening procedure for rural, impoverished patients, 16% of asymptomatic patients who were screened by sigmoidoscopy and 23% of patients with a positive test for fecal occult blood were found to have a polyp or carcinoma. Flexible sigmoidoscopy appears to be an important part of the physical examination of patients older than 50. It is a test that can readily be done by primary care physicians in a rural setting. "
neoplasms,Vaginal mullerian cyst presenting as an anterior enterocele: a case report. A case is discussed of an extremely large vaginal mullerian cyst that presented as an anterior enterocele. Sonographic and radiologic studies are described. The patient underwent operative excision of the cyst with reconstructive vaginoplasty. 
neoplasms,"Use of cytoplasmic 5'nucleotidase for differentiating malignant from benign monoclonal gammopathies. Bone marrow smears from 15 patients with multiple myeloma, 15 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and 15 control subjects were examined for the presence of cytoplasmic 5'nucleotidase (c5NT) in plasma cells. Plasma cell positivity for c5NT (mean and 95% confidence interval) in patients with multiple myeloma numbered 46.4% (38.0-54.8%), in those with MGUS it was 15.3% (11.1-19.6%), and in control subjects it was 1.2% (0.3-2.1%). These findings indicate that c5NT can be used to differentiate benign from malignant monoclonal gammopathies. "
neoplasms,"The epithelial changes associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva: a review of the clinical, histological and viral findings in 78 women. Seventy-eight excised specimens of squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva were reviewed retrospectively for the presence of lichen sclerosus or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) at sites proximal to the tumour or more distant. Lichen sclerosus was evident in 61% and VIN alone in 31%. VIN III (differentiated) was associated with over 50% of the specimens with lichen sclerosus. HPV 16 was found in six of the 11 VIN lesions, investigated but in none of the six with lichen sclerosus. "
neoplasms,"The Van Nes tibial rotationplasty. A functionally viable reconstructive procedure in children who have a tumor of the distal end of the femur. Twelve patients who had a malignant tumor of the distal end of the femur were treated with a Van Nes tibial rotationplasty. The survival rates were comparable with those for above-the-knee amputees and patients who had an endoprosthetic replacement. The results of functional testing showed that these patients performed as well as those who had endoprosthetic replacement and better than those who had above-the-knee amputation. Rotationplasty is therefore a favorable alternative to amputation or endoprosthetic replacement, either as a primary or as a salvage procedure. "
neoplasms,"Resolution of inferior vena cava syndrome after embolization of a hepatic adenoma. A 77-year-old man presented with severe pruritus and massive lower body edema. Computerized axial tomography of the abdomen showed a large hepatic mass compressing the inferior vena cava, and a liver biopsy specimen showed hepatic adenoma. Embolization of vessels feeding the hepatic tumor resulted in complete resolution of pruritus and ascites, and clinical remission has persisted for 1 year following partial obliteration of tumor vasculature. Angiographic ablation of tumor blood supply represents a nonoperative means for inducing clinical remission in patients with symptomatic hepatic adenoma who are at high surgical risk. "
neoplasms,"Adenocarcinoma arising in a foregut cyst of the mediastinum. A case of malignant transformation in a mediastinal cyst of the esophageal reduplication type is presented. The cyst had been recognized 39 years previously, but remained asymptomatic until sudden growth occurred. It was resected totally from the esophagus and the patient recovered well. A review of the literature showed that malignancy in mediastinal foregut cysts is extremely rare. "
neoplasms,"Genotypic analyses of Richter's syndrome. The authors report the immunogenotype of two cases of Richter's syndrome. The immunoglobulin gene rearrangement pattern obtained on Southern Blot analysis was found in both cases to be the same in leukemic blood cells and in the tissue involved by the lymphoma. The beta chain and gamma chain T-cell receptor gene rearrangement pattern exhibited a germ-line configuration in the peripheral blood cells and in the lymph node in Case 2, whereas in Case 1 the lymph node had a gene rearrangement in the beta chain, as well as in the gamma chain T-cell receptor, and the leukemic cells from bone marrow were found to be in a germ-line configuration for T-cell receptors (beta and gamma chains). "
neoplasms,Gastrointestinal intraluminal pH in normal subjects and those with colorectal adenoma or carcinoma. Recent evidence suggests that the production of colorectal carcinogens is facilitated when the pH of the colonic contents is alkaline. It follows that the colonic intraluminal pH of patients with colorectal neoplasms should be higher than in normal subjects. Gastrointestinal pH has been measured in 30 patients with colorectal cancer and 37 patients with benign colorectal adenomas (using a pH sensitive radiotelemetry capsule). These values have been compared with those recorded in 66 normal subjects. No differences in gastrointestinal pH were found and the results did not support the hypothesis that colonic pH plays a role in the aetiology of colorectal neoplasia. 
neoplasms,The fastigial pressor response. Case report. A distinct vasomotor and cardioregulatory response first identified experimentally was elicited intraoperatively in a 6-year-old girl by local mechanical stimulation in the vicinity of the fastigial nucleus of the cerebellum. These findings are discussed in the light of current experimental knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the fastigial pressor response. 
neoplasms,"Melanocytic hyperplasia of the oral mucosa. Lesions that exhibit melanocytic hyperplasia are uncommon in the oral mucosa. They are even more rare than the various morphologic types of nevomelanocytic lesions. This article reports the clinicopathologic features of oral lesions diagnosed as lentigo simplex, junctional lentigo (""jentigo""), atypical melanocytic hyperplasia (melanoma in situ), and melanocanthoma. The proper terminology for these lesions is also discussed. "
neoplasms,Haemangiosarcoma of the maxillary antrum. Angiosarcomas are extremely rare in the head and neck and the histological diagnosis is often difficult. We present a case of a haemangiosarcoma of the maxillary antrum in a 33 year old male. The histological diagnosis and subsequent management are discussed. 
neoplasms,"Reduced psychological morbidity after breast conservation. Psychological morbidity was compared in 52 patients treated by mastectomy and 67 patients treated by lumpectomy for early breast cancer. An informal counselling service was provided for all patients. Morbidity was measured at 6, 9 and 12 months after surgery with two self-rating scales: the general health questionnaire and the Leeds depression and anxiety scales. There was a significant excess of severe depression in the mastectomy group. In contrast to the findings of previous research, this result suggests that breast conservation reduces psychological morbidity. "
neoplasms,"Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome complicating T-cell lymphoma: unusual or unrecognized? Malnutrition rather than alcohol abuse is the common element in most cases of WKS. Our report may be the first to identify both the clinical and neuropathologic features of the syndrome in a patient with T-cell lymphoma. The coincidence of these two illnesses underscores a need to consider Wernicke's encephalopathy in debilitated individuals with malignancy or other chronic illnesses, highlights an atypical presentation of acute Wernicke's encephalopathy, and demonstrats the precipitation of that syndrome by glucose feeding. Attention to a patient's nutritional status and the liberal use of thiamine may prompt early recognition of the syndrome or prevent it entirely. "
neoplasms,"Oral manifestations of HIV infection and their management. I. More common lesions. Oral lesions are common at all stages of HIV infection. This first of two articles reviews the clinical features and pathogenesis of common oral manifestations of HIV disease (candidiasis, hairy leukoplakia, Kaposi's sarcoma, and HIV-related periodontal disease) and considers current treatment measures. "
neoplasms,"A clonal CD4-positive T-cell line established from the blood of a patient with Sezary syndrome. The reported inability to establish long-term T-cell lines from the blood of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma patients with circulating neoplastic T cells has hindered the development of an in vitro system to investigate Sezary syndrome. We have established a rapidly proliferating T-cell line from the peripheral blood of a patient with Sezary syndrome, which expresses a mature helper T-cell phenotype and contains cytogenetic abnormalities and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements identical to those in the patient's blood. The method of establishment and characteristics of this line are described. "
neoplasms,"Primary central nervous system T-cell lymphoma. Case report. Primary central nervous system (CNS) T-cell lymphoma is extremely rare. The present case report provides immunocytochemical evidence for a cerebellar CNS T-cell lymphoma. The patient underwent surgery followed by radiation therapy and is alive and well 36 months postoperatively. The clinical and pathological features of primary CNS T-cell lymphoma as well as diagnostic measures and treatment options are discussed, together with a compilation of all previous case reports of primary CNS T-cell lymphomas. "
neoplasms,"Tumors of the central nervous system. Improvement in outcome through a multimodality approach. More children with CNS tumors will continue to be cured of their neoplasms as a result of improved surgical, radiotherapeutic, and chemotherapeutic intervention. The complex problems seen in these patients mandate their treatment at academic centers actively involved in therapeutic investigations and capable of providing comprehensive multidisciplinary care. "
neoplasms,"Toxic dermatitis induced by 10-ethyl-10-deaza-aminopterin (10-EdAM), a novel antifolate. A new methotrexate analog, 10-ethyl-10-deaza-aminopterin (10-EdAM), was found to induce a particular form of skin toxicity different than the skin rash reported to result from methotrexate. At histologic examination, it was found to be a toxic dermatitis that clinically most often first appears on the lower legs but can occur anywhere in the body, especially if treatment is continued. Nine cases are reported. A specific risk factor could not yet be identified. Discontinuation of 10-EdAM administration leads to complete healing; concomitant corticosteroid treatment also induces healing. "
neoplasms,"Le Fort I osteotomy approach to the skull base. Horizontal osteotomy allows the surgeon to safely down-fracture the maxilla for wide exposure of the central skull base. This surgical approach is easily extended posteriorly in the midline to include the clivus and the arch of C1, providing 8 cm of horizontal anterior exposure and 5 cm of posterior. Wide operative exposure and a low rate of complications afford superior functional and cosmetic preservation in removing tumors of the central cranial base. "
neoplasms,"Herniation of the antral membrane through an extraction site. Report of a case. A case of herniation of the antral membrane through a recent extraction site is presented. The lesion was initially diagnosed as a tumor by the referring dentist. Oroantral fistulas are not an uncommon finding after dental extractions. It is rare, however, to see herniation of the antral membrane with large polyps extending through the fistula into the oral cavity. A search of the literature revealed only two other such cases. Surgical removal of the polyps and closure of the oroantral fistula by means of a buccal sliding flap technique is discussed. "
neoplasms,"Neodymium: YAG laser hysteroscopy in large submucous fibroids. The preoperative use of a potent, subcutaneously injected gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) was evaluated in a series of 60 women with large submucosal fibroids. Myomectomy by hysteroscopy and Nd:YAG laser was easily performed. In 12 cases, the largest portion of the myoma was not inside the uterine cavity and myomectomy was carried by a two-step hysteroscopy. In women who wished to become pregnant, a pregnancy rate of 66% was achieved. Advantages of preoperative use of a GnRH-a are (1) the significant decrease of the fibroid size, (2) a lower fluid absorption, and (3) the restoration of a normal hemoglobin concentration. "
neoplasms,"Complications associated with limb salvage for extremity sarcomas and their management. A retrospective clinical review of 100 consecutive patients with extremity sarcomas managed by limb salvage operations was performed to evaluate local tumor control and morbidity. The mean follow-up period was 45.1 months. Overall survival was 86%. There were local recurrences in 3% of patients, and 26 complications in 22 patients. Wound necrosis was the most frequent complication. Failure of allogeneic bone graft operations occurred in 25 patients. Most of the complications were salvageable without loss of limb. Limb salvage is an acceptable surgical treatment of extremity sarcomas based on adequate local control and minimal morbidity. "
neoplasms,"Cutaneous malignant melanoma metastatic to the choroid. Cutaneous malignant melanoma metastatic to the eye is a well-documented occurrence in the ophthalmic literature. Typically, ocular metastatic disease occurs concomitantly with or following the documentation of disseminated metastases. We present the clinical and histopathologic findings in a 62-year-old man whose first manifestation of metastatic cutaneous melanoma was his choroidal lesion. "
neoplasms,"Diffuse esophageal leiomyomatosis in a patient with Alport syndrome: CT demonstration. In a patient with progressive dysphagia, postprandial vomiting, and a history of Alport syndrome, barium and manometric studies had been interpreted as consistent with achalasia, but a subsequent computed tomographic (CT) scan of the thorax was suggestive of a lower esophageal intramural mass. Multiple leiomyomas of the esophagus were later proved at thoracotomy. Differences between adult and pediatric leiomyomas and the association of leiomyomas with Alport syndrome are discussed. "
neoplasms,"Complete remission in refractory anaplastic adult Wilms' tumor treated with cisplatin and etoposide. A 61-year-old woman underwent a left radical nephrectomy for Stage II anaplastic Wilm's tumor. She received no adjuvant therapy. One year later computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed a mass in the left renal fossa and retroperitoneal adenopathy. A CT-guided needle biopsy was nondiagnostic. The patient had progressive disease after treatment with dactinomycin, doxorubicin, and vincristine, but achieved a complete response after treatment with cisplatin and etoposide. The therapy of Wilms' tumor in adults is discussed. "
neoplasms,"Mycosis fungoides-like lesions associated with phenytoin and carbamazepine therapy. We report the cases of four patients who were taking the anticonvulsant drugs phenytoin or carbamazepine and in whom skin lesions developed that showed histologic features suggestive of mycosis fungoides. Two patients had a solitary lesion on the trunk, whereas the other two patients had multiple plaques. In all four patients systemic signs were absent. "
neoplasms,"Polycystic ovary syndrome. Polycystic ovary syndrome is a disorder of unknown cause characterized by anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and gonadotropin secretory abnormalities producing oligo-ovulation or anovulation. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are important features of this syndrome. Because other causes of androgen excess may produce similar clinical and biochemical findings, PCO remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Treatment is directed toward relieving symptoms of hyperandrogenemia in order to stimulate ovulation, correcting obesity, and inducing regular menses to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. "
neoplasms,"Myeloma manifesting as a large jugular tumor: case report. The authors report a case of cranial plasmacytoma with multiple myelomas and palsy of the lower cranial nerves. The osteolytic lesion adjacent to the jugular foramen was demonstrated by an angiogram to be exceedingly hypervascular, with arteriovenous shunting resembling that seen in paragangliomas. Forty-five cases of cranial and intracranial plasmacytoma from the literature were reviewed. The findings indicate that a cranial plasmacytoma commonly appears to be a hypervascular tumor, whereas most dural tumors or intraparenchymal tumors have poor vascularity. "
neoplasms,"The role of ras gene mutations in myeloproliferative disorders. Mutations in the ras genes frequently are found in myeloproliferative disorders. These abnormalities have prognostic significance in the myelodysplastic syndromes, but their clinical importance in other hematopathic states remains unclear. The study of this gene in leukemic conditions is providing insights into the genetic pathways leading to leukemic progression. "
neoplasms,"Antibodies in anti-HBe-positive patient sera bind to an HBe protein expressed on the cell surface of human hepatoma cells: implications for virus clearance. The relevance of the recently described membrane-bound form of the HBe protein for the antiviral immune response was examined. The data show that antibodies in anti-HBe, but not in anti-HBc-positive human sera efficiently bind to the membrane expressed HBe. No evidence was obtained that the HBc can reach the cell surface in a form that can be detected with human antibodies. The findings suggest that the decline of virus titer that is usually observed after seroconversion from HBe to anti-HBe might be the result of an antibody-mediated elimination of infected cells. "
neoplasms,Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in malignant mesothelioma of tunica vaginalis testis. A case of metastatic mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis testis in a 57-year-old man is reported. Clinicopathological findings and treatment options are reviewed. 
neoplasms,"Fatal disseminated mycobacterial infection following intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin. We describe a fatal case of disseminated mycobacteriosis after intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy. We summarize the prior safety record of this therapeutic modality, discuss local and systemic pathophysiological mechanisms by which dissemination might have occurred, and review the reported clinical experience with antituberculous chemotherapy for significant bacillus Calmette-Guerin infection. Finally, we offer suggestions for prophylaxis of certain patients with a history of exposure to intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin. "
neoplasms,The use of ketoconazole in ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone syndrome. The authors report a patient with ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome (EAS) resulting from small cell lung cancer. Treatment with ketoconazole (KCZ) resulted in significant suppression of serum cortisol levels. The authors confirmed KCZ to be a useful adjunct in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. 
neoplasms,Fluorescein angiography in ciliary body melanomas. We retrospectively studied the value of iris fluorescein angiography in predicitng benignity or malignancy in 10 cases of ciliary body melanoma with iris extension. No correlation between fluorescein-angiographic appearance and histopathologic features was observed. Fluorescein angiography adds little to the management of ciliary body melanomas with iris extension. 
nervous system diseases,"Modifying the translabyrinthine approach to preserve hearing during acoustic tumour surgery. Removing an acoustic schwannoma using the translabyrinthine approach has previously been considered incompatible with hearing preservation. By modifying the approach and preventing the loss of endolymph, we have successfully removed an intracanalicular acoustic schwannoma, which originated from the inferior vestibular nerve, and preserved hearing in the operated ear. This report represents the preliminary findings using this particular technique in the management of an intracanalicular acoustic tumour. "
nervous system diseases,"Giant cell arteritis. A case with unusual neurologic manifestations and a normal sedimentation rate. Giant cell (temporal) arteritis is a serious inflammatory condition that can lead to blindness, stroke, or other adverse sequelae if not properly treated. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate has traditionally been emphasized as a criterion for making this diagnosis. Delays in diagnosis and unnecessary testing may occur when a patient presents with a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate and a clinical history consistent with this condition. We describe a patient with giant cell arteritis who presented with a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate and who subsequently developed devastating central nervous system complications. "
nervous system diseases,"Hypercalcemia in infants presenting with apnea. To our knowledge apnea in infants has not been associated with hypercalcemia. We describe seven hypercalcemic infants aged 2 days to 3 months who had presented with apnea; six of the seven were otherwise healthy. The apneic attacks were brief, and normal breathing was restored spontaneously or after tactile stimulation. The attacks stopped and the apnea monitoring was discontinued when the children were 1 month to 2 years of age. The only abnormal finding common to all of the patients was hypercalcemia. Idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia was diagnosed in six of the patients and familial benign hypercalcemia in one. Our findings suggest that determination of the plasma calcium level be included in the investigation of apnea in infancy. "
nervous system diseases,"Prognostic factors in the treatment of alopecia areata with diphenylcyclopropenone. One hundred thirty-nine patients with alopecia areata were treated with diphenylcyclopropenone. Before treatment, 85 patients had subtotal or total hair loss (greater than 90% bald area) and in the remaining patients scalp involvement was between 40% and 90%. The following three factors were found to be of prognostic significance: type of alopecia areata as documented before treatment, duration of the disease before therapy, and presence of nail changes. Other factors such as age at onset, sex, presence of atopic features, the extent of variation in the range of diphenylcyclopropenone concentrations during treatment, and sleep disturbances caused by pruritus did not influence the prognosis significantly. "
nervous system diseases,"Myxomatous cyst of the brachial plexus. Case report. The case of a myxomatous cyst of the brachial plexus is presented. The clinical course is reported, and the frequency of the lesion, diagnostic workup, histopathology, and surgical therapy are discussed. "
nervous system diseases,"Capsular genu syndrome. We report 5 patients with unilateral infarct and 1 with hemorrhage limited to the genu of the internal capsule. The most prominent finding was contralateral facial and lingual hemiparesis with dysarthria. Three patients also showed unilateral mastication-palatal-pharyngeal weakness, and 1 had unilateral vocal cord paresis. Mild limb involvement was limited to hand weakness in 4 patients. Our findings suggest that the majority of motor corticopontine and corticocobulbar fibers are located in the genu of the internal capsule. The faciolingual syndrome and its variants are highly suggestive of capsular genu stroke. "
nervous system diseases,"Dwarf locus mutants lacking three pituitary cell types result from mutations in the POU-domain gene pit-1. Mutations at the mouse dwarf locus (dw) interrupt the normal development of the anterior pituitary gland, resulting in the loss of expression of growth hormone, prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone, and hypoplasia of their respective cell types. Disruptions in the gene encoding the POU-domain transcription factor, Pit-1, occur in both characterized alleles of the dwarf locus. The data indicate that Pit-1 is necessary for the specification of the phenotype of three cell types in the anterior pituitary, and directly link a transcription factor to commitment and progression events in mammalian organogenesis. "
nervous system diseases,"'Locked-in syndrome' for 27 years following a viral illness: clinical and pathologic findings. We describe a man who, after a presumed encephalitic illness, was ""locked-in"" for 27 years. His CT and autopsy findings showed atrophy of the brainstem and a cystic lesion at the base of the pons. He survived longer than most other patients in a similar state. "
nervous system diseases,"Reinforcement of incontinent stools in the treatment of encopresis. In this paper, fecal incontinence and constipation were treated in two mentally retarded individuals using a novel intervention wherein incontinent stools were first rewarded in order to increase the frequency of bowel movements. This intervention was implemented only after more traditional pediatric and behavioral treatments were unsuccessful. The reinforcement of incontinent stools procedure resulted in an increase in both the frequency and the number of continent stools for both individuals. Hypotheses regarding the failure of previous treatments and the success of the current treatment are discussed as well as directions for future research. "
nervous system diseases,Cervico-ocular function in patients with spasmodic torticollis. The cervico-ocular (COR) and active and passive vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VOR) were measured in seven patients with spasmodic torticollis (ST) and six normal controls. The COR was found to be weak or absent in both groups. The VOR gain was similar in the two groups but five patients had a significant asymmetry of the response. There was no evidence of abnormal cervico-vestibular interaction during active head rotation. The study suggests that the VOR asymmetry frequently found in ST cannot be explained on the basis of an abnormal cervical input. 
nervous system diseases,Vertebrobasilar occlusion following minor trauma in an 8-year-old boy. An 8-year-old boy developed seizures and coma 2 days after a trivial bicycle accident. Computed tomography failed to show pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed infarction of the pons and right cerebellum. Angiography showed occlusion of the right vertebral and basilar arteries. Minor traumatic injuries to the cervical spine may result in vertebrobasilar occlusion. The neurologic manifestations of this disorder and emergency department diagnosis and management are discussed. 
nervous system diseases,A case of unilateral posterior ischemic optic neuropathy after radical neck dissection. We present a case of unilateral posterior ischemic optic neuropathy after bilateral radical neck dissection. Etiologic factors are discussed. 
nervous system diseases,OKT3 encephalopathy. OKT3 therapy for induction immunosuppression in a patient who underwent renal transplantation produced obtundation and quadriparesis associated with computed tomographic scan evidence of brain edema. These findings resolved over 3 days with supportive therapy and OKT3 withdrawal. 
nervous system diseases,"A new diagnostic test for carpal tunnel syndrome. A new test, called the carpal compression test, consists of application of direct pressure on the carpal tunnel and the underlying median nerve. The results of the Tinel percussion test, the Phalen wrist-flexion test, and the new test were evaluated in thirty-one patients (forty-six hands) in whom the presence of carpal tunnel syndrome had been proved electrodiagnostically, as well as in a control group of fifty subjects. For the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome, the carpal compression test was found to be more sensitive and specific than the Tinel and Phalen tests. "
nervous system diseases,"Radiographic manifestations of anomalies of the brain. Congenital brain anomalies are classified as developmental anomalies, effects of teratogens, errors of histogenesis, or sequelae of infections. The imaging options for delineation of these anomalies are many; a basic understanding of the disorder is central to the effective choice of imaging modality. This review begins with a brief overview of embryogenesis then reviews the common congenital brain anomalies encountered in infants. "
nervous system diseases,"Tuberothalamic infarct after division of a hypoplastic posterior communicating artery for clipping of a basilar tip aneurysm: case report. The authors present a case of a tuberothalamic infarct subsequent to division of the posterior communicating artery for clipping of a high-lying aneurysm of the basilar bifurcation using the pterional approach. In view of this clinical observation and some particular aspects of the microsurgical anatomy of the perforating vessels of the posterior communicating artery, we conclude that interrupting this parent vessel carries a significant risk of infarction. "
nervous system diseases,"Microangiopathy in the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. The eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with the ingestion of L-tryptophan was recognized in late 1989. We describe our pathologic study of skin, fascial, and muscle biopsies from 21 patients evaluated by light microscopy, histochemistry, and electron microscopy. A perivascular, lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils was present in the dermis, fascia, and skeletal muscle. Lymphocytic infiltration of arteries and arterioles was seen. Ultrastructurally, capillary and arteriolar endothelial cell thickening and necrosis was present. This microangiopathy suggests that ischemia may be a contributing factor to the findings in this syndrome. "
nervous system diseases,Vascular abnormalities in epidermal nevus syndrome. We report a patient with epidermal nevus syndrome and right hemispheric infarct and review 3 others with neurologic manifestations best explained by ischemia or hemorrhage. Each had a significant vascular abnormality such as occlusion or blood vessel dysplasia. None had hemimegalencephaly. We hypothesize that underlying vascular dysplasia is the cause of the neurologic lesions in these patients. 
nervous system diseases,"Magnetoencephalographic localization of interictal spike sources. Case report. The reliability of localization of interictal spike sources using magnetoencephalography (MEG) was examined by repeated measurements in a patient with temporal lobe epilepsy. During two preoperative recording sessions, the estimated sources, projected onto magnetic resonance images of the patient's brain, were found to lie less than 1 cm apart within the area subsequently resected. The MEG localization was in close agreement with intraoperative cortical recordings. "
nervous system diseases,"Cerebral vein thrombosis shown by MRI. A 46 year old man with a short history of left facial pain and numbness, and subsequently headaches, had a normal physical examination and a normal CT scan of head. Lumbar puncture yielded normal CSF under increased pressure. MRI showed thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus, subsequently confirmed by angiography. MRI is a sensitive test for detecting intracranial venous thrombosis, and may be the investigation of choice when this disorder is suspected. "
nervous system diseases,"Acute naming deficits following dominant temporal lobectomy: prediction by age at 1st risk for seizures. Age at 1st risk for seizures may predict anomia following dominant anterior temporal lobectomy. We assessed confrontation naming before and 2 to 3 weeks after surgery in 45 right-handed patients grouped by side of focus and presence or absence of early (less than or equal to 5 years) risk factors. After left lobectomy, 6 of 10 (60%) patients with no early risks demonstrated significant decline (greater than or equal to 25%) in naming, but none of the patients with early risks showed this decline. After right lobectomy, there was no change. Cerebral representation of naming may be atypical in patients with early risks. "
nervous system diseases,"Unusual cerebral manifestations in hereditary fructose intolerance. Five children with hereditary fructose intolerance developed symptoms of neurological impairment. In three of them, neurological involvement was related to the acute hepatic toxicity of fructose (hypoglycemia, abnormal coagulation, cardiovascular collapse); in the other two, such a relationship could not be demonstrated. Neurological impairment is not classic in hereditary fructose intolerance, but its occurrence in the acute phase of the disease is possible and does not constitute an argument against the diagnosis. "
nervous system diseases,"Failed acromioplasty for impingement syndrome. We evaluated 67 shoulders in 65 patients who had pain and dysfunction for more than two years after an initial acromioplasty for impingement syndrome without a rotator cuff tear. In addition to a thorough history, physical examination, local anaesthesia injection and any other necessary investigations all patients had arthroscopic evaluation of the shoulder. In 27 shoulders there had been diagnostic errors, and in 28 operative errors; only in 12 had the diagnosis and the operative procedure both been correct. Subsequent operative intervention in patients not receiving worker's compensation benefit had a 75% success rate, whereas in those receiving such benefits the success rate was only 46%. "
nervous system diseases,"Modification of pain on injection of propofol--a comparison between lignocaine and procaine. Pain on injection of propofol was assessed in a controlled, randomised study of 273 patients. They received either lignocaine 10 mg, procaine 10 mg or isotonic saline 0.5 ml, 15 seconds before the injection of propofol into a vein on the back of the hand. The incidence of pain on injection in the control group (51%) was comparable with other studies. Lignocaine and procaine both significantly reduced the pain (35% and 34% respectively, p less than 0.05) but there was no statistical difference between these two groups. "
nervous system diseases,"The molecular biology of occlusive stroke in childhood. It is very likely that many of the same factors involved in occlusive disease in the adult are operative in the child. The major difference may be in the factors that damage endothelium in these two age groups and thereby initiate this catastrophe (atherosclerosis versus ""other"" causes of endothelial changes). Our task in this next decade is the rational exploration of the effects of endothelium-mediated kinins, endothelial secretory products, angiospasm, platelet aggregration, prostaglandins, and lipoproteins on pediatric stroke. "
nervous system diseases,"Acute central nervous system symptoms caused by ibuprofen in connective tissue disease. We describe 2 cases of acute encephalopathy in patients with connective tissue disease caused by small doses of ibuprofen. In addition to aseptic meningitis, both patients had altered mental status and focal neurologic signs, ophthalmoplegia in one and hemiparesis in the other. The spectrum of neurologic manifestations of ibuprofen hypersensitivity is reviewed. "
nervous system diseases,"The shoulder in multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. One hundred shoulders were assessed in 50 patients with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, of which one-third were found to have bilateral symptoms. Two distinct clinical and radiological groups emerged. Those with minor epiphyseal abnormalities developed painful osteoarthritis in middle age, but retained shoulder movement until the secondary changes were advanced. Those with 'hatchet head' shoulders likewise became painful in the fifth and sixth decades but had minimal glenohumeral movement from an early stage. "
nervous system diseases,"Sleepwalking precipitated by treatment of sleep apnea with nasal CPAP. A 33-year-old man with a long history of snoring, observed apneic episodes, and excessive daytime sleepiness, underwent all-night polysomnography, which demonstrated severe obstructive sleep apnea. During the nasal CPAP trial, two episodes of sleepwalking were observed during a period of delta sleep rebound. "
nervous system diseases,Semantic deterioration in Alzheimer's: the patterns to expect. Differentiating language changes between the normal aged and those in the early stages of dementia is never simple. Knowing the differences and what to expect can aid in making this diagnosis. 
nervous system diseases,"Muscle biopsy for diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility in two patients with severe exercise-induced myolysis. Muscle biopsy and in vitro contracture tests for diagnosis of susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia (MH) were performed in two patients who had developed fever and severe myolysis during exercise. MH susceptibility was confirmed in one patient, but in the other, exercise-induced heat stroke proved to be the correct diagnosis. Clinical presentation and epidemiology of exercise-induced MH and its relation to the heat stroke syndrome are discussed. "
nervous system diseases,"Lesions of the mid-shaft of the humerus presenting as shoulder capsulitis. We describe three patients who presented with pain and restriction of movement at the shoulder suggestive of capsulitis, but proved to have lesions of the mid-shaft of the humerus. It is important to be aware of the possibility of this cause of a 'frozen shoulder', since radiographs of the shoulder are usually cropped at the mid-humerus and lesions at this level may easily be missed. A radiograph of the entire humerus, or an isotope bone scan, may be more useful than repeated shoulder radiographs in patients whose shoulder symptoms do not respond to standard treatment. "
nervous system diseases,"Reversible brain death. A manifestation of amitriptyline overdose. Tricyclic antidepressants are known to cause central nervous system depression. However, a generalized depression of brainstem functions is rarely reported. We report a patient in deep coma with complete absence of brain-stem reflexes after she had taken a large quantity of amitriptyline. With continuous supportive treatment, she eventually regained all neurologic function and made a full recovery. "
nervous system diseases,"Unilateral asterixis. We describe three patients with unilateral asterixis. One diabetic patient with a moderately-sized haematoma in the left putamen initially developed bilateral and symmetrical asterixis, which became confined to the right side as his diabetes mellitus was controlled. Two patients showed unilateral asterixis due to haematomas in the contralateral basal ganglia and thalamus, respectively. The present findings indicate that not only lesions of the thalamus but also those of the basal ganglia can cause unilateral asterixis, and bilateral and symmetrical asterixis does not necessarily exclude the presence of a focal mass lesion in the cerebrum. "
nervous system diseases,"Ubiquitin immunoreactivity in kuru plaques in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Cerebellar kuru plaques in 2 cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease were studied immunohistochemically. Similar to cerebellar senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease, many kuru plaques contained ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative small granular elements, presumably representing dystrophic neurites. Our results suggest that similar mechanisms are involved in neuritic changes in cerebellar plaques in Creutzfeldt-Jakob and Alzheimer's diseases despite differences of amyloid proteins in the plaques. "
nervous system diseases,Surgical technique for implantation of the neurocybernetic prosthesis. The surgical technique for the implantation of the neurocybernetic prosthesis is described in detail. This procedure is straightforward and is easily carried out by surgeons familiar with carotid surgery. 
nervous system diseases,"Left alien hand sign and mirror writing after left anterior cerebral artery infarction. A 43-year-old, right-handed man was admitted complaining of peculiar movements of his left hand. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed an infarct area in the territory of the left anterior cerebral artery. The abnormal movements of the left hand were diagnosed as so-called alien hand sign. This patient also exhibited mirror writing with his left hand. The clinical manifestations and neuroradiological findings of this case are described in detail, and the possible mechanisms of these extremely rare combinations of alien hand sign and mirror writing are discussed. "
nervous system diseases,"Hemiparkinsonism as a complication of an Ommaya reservoir. Case report. The authors describe the case of a 28-year-old woman who developed the following symptoms in her right hand: a lasting resting tremor, transient focal rigidity, and paresthesia. These deficits occurred following treatment with intrathecal methotrexate via an Ommaya reservoir which was placed too deeply, resulting in trauma to the contralateral mesencephalon. "
nervous system diseases,"Transient hyperprolactinemia is associated with a midcycle luteinizing hormone surge. This study demonstrates that LH surge cycles in IVF patients were associated with significantly higher serum PRL concentrations than cycles in which a spontaneous LH surge did not occur. Our findings support the hypothesis of concomitant LH and PRL release at the time of the midcycle gonadotropin surge, as well as that of estrogen sensitization of pituitary lactotropes, and suggest a possible mechanism for transient midcycle hyperprolactinemia. "
nervous system diseases,"Acupuncture and chronic pain: a criteria-based meta-analysis. A literature search revealed 51 controlled clinical studies on the effectiveness of acupuncture in chronic pain. These studies were reviewed using a list of 18 predefined methodological criteria. A maximum of 100 points for study design could be earned in four main categories: (a) comparability of prognosis, (b) adequate intervention, (c) adequate effect measurement and (d) data presentation. The quality of even the better studies proved to be mediocre. No study earned more than 62% of the maximum score. The results from the better studies (greater than or equal to 50% of the maximum score) are highly contradictory. The efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic pain remains doubtful. "
nervous system diseases,An epithelial cyst in the cerebellopontine angle. Case report. A case of a benign epithelial cyst in the posterior cranial fossa is described. It had the unique histological feature of a double-layered cuboidal epithelial lining. Detailed immunohistochemical and electron microscopic studies supported an endodermal origin. The differential diagnosis and the histogenesis of epithelial cysts in the central nervous system are discussed. 
nervous system diseases,Intradural herniation of a thoracic disc presenting as flaccid paraplegia: case report. A case of intradural herniation of a thoracic disc in a patient with a flaccid paraplegia is described. Intradural herniation of a thoracic disc is considered a rare event. A review of the relevant patient literature revealed 14 other reports involving 28 patients. No other report has described a patient with an intradural thoracic disc herniation who developed a flaccid paraplegia. 
nervous system diseases,Cardiac echinococcosis with fatal intracerebral embolism. A previously well 7 year old boy presented with sudden loss of consciousness and fitting. No evidence of trauma or space occupying lesion was identified. Death occurred the next day due to cerebral infarction caused by embolised fragments from a ruptured left ventricular hydatid cyst that was found at necropsy. 
nervous system diseases,"The iris in Williams syndrome. Forty three children with Williams syndrome and 124 control subjects had their eyes photographed. The photographs were examined by three ophthalmologists and four geneticists of varying experience. A stellate pattern was noted more often in the irides of patients with Williams syndrome (51%) than in those of the control subjects (12%), and was more difficult to detect, or was absent, in heavily pigmented irides. We conclude that the stellate pattern is of diagnostic importance, particularly if the pattern is carefully defined and the clinician is experienced. "
nervous system diseases,"Eosinophilic meningitis: cause of a chronic pain syndrome. Three tourists developed eosinophilic meningitis after visiting the Fijian Islands. Two had a severe and long lasting illness with chronic intractable pain. In one patient electrophysiological studies and MRI scan of the brain were abnormal and provided evidence of both radicular and cerebral parenchymal involvement by the most likely causative agent, Angiostrongylus cantonensis. "
nervous system diseases,"Ataxia and peripheral neuropathy: a benign variant of peroxisome dysgenesis. A 5-year-old boy with panperoxisomal dysfunction is described. Clinical features included hypotonia, areflexia, and ataxia. Cognition, vision, hearing, and hepatic function were normal. A panel of peroxisomal markers, including very-long-chain fatty acids, phytanic acid, pipecolic acid, and catalase compartmentalization, were abnormal. This is a uniquely benign syndrome of disordered peroxisome biogenesis. "
nervous system diseases,"Results of N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists in perinatal cerebral asphyxia therapy. Perinatal cerebral asphyxia, which results in significant neurologic and cognitive disabilities in infants and children, remains a major health problem. Potential neurologic sequelae include cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and epilepsy. Over the next few years, neuroprotective agents that prevent asphyxial neuronal injury and death are likely to be developed. These agents may also be effective in prophylaxis and treatment of chronic neurologic disorders, including epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington disease. "
nervous system diseases,"Reversible myopathy due to labetalol. A severe, generalized myopathy developed in 2 children treated with labetalol. An 11-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy demonstrated proximal weakness and markedly elevated creatine kinase levels during labetalol therapy. Clinical improvement began immediately when labetalol administration was halted; muscle strength was normal within 2 months. Muscle biopsies were consistent with rhabdomyolysis. "
nervous system diseases,"Blepharospasm-oromandibular dystonia associated with a left cerebellopontine angle meningioma. Blepharospasm-oromandibular dystonia is characterized by the presence of spasms of the orbicularis oculi (blepharospasm) and of the lower facial or oromandibular muscles. A patient with this syndrome is presented in which a left cerebellopontine angle meningioma appeared to act as a triggering mechanism for the development of this disorder. On the basis of this report, we recommend that physicians search for this tumor in patients with this disorder. "
nervous system diseases,"Rheumatoid arthritis and comorbidity. Data collected from 288 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) indicated that 54% of respondents also reported other chronic conditions, and that 20% rated at least one of these other conditions as severe. Both the frequency and severity of these comorbidities affected scores on measures of depressive symptoms, social connectedness and on the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales. These findings suggest that the absence of controls for comorbidity may bias measures of functional status among patients with RA. "
nervous system diseases,"Tarsal tunnel syndrome in athletes. Case reports and literature review. Tarsal tunnel syndrome is being seen in increasing frequency in the athletic population, especially in the running athlete. The sports medicine physician must be cognizant of this entity, including proper diagnostic testing and management. "
nervous system diseases,Auditory brain stem implant: effect of tumor size and preoperative hearing level on function. The auditory brain stem implant is an investigational device designed to provide hearing sensations to patients without functioning auditory nerves. We analyzed results from 17 implants in 15 patients to determine if tumor size or preoperative hearing level might be related to proper device function. We found no significant correlation between preoperative hearing level or tumor size and device function. We also found no significant correlation between preoperative hearing level and tumor size in these 15 patients. 
nervous system diseases,"Posttraumatic torticollis. We report six cases of torticollis precipitated by neck trauma. The dystonia began 1 to 4 days after the trauma and differed clinically from idiopathic torticollis by marked limitation of range of motion, lack of improvement after sleep (""honeymoon period""), and absence of geste antagonistique. Worsening with action was not present; nor was there improvement with support as seen with idiopathic torticollis. Onset of pain immediately after the trauma and marked spasms of the paracervical muscles were other predominant features. Anticholinergic therapy was without benefit; however, some improvement occurred with botulinum toxin injection. It is concluded that torticollis can be caused by peripheral trauma and that it has unique clinical characteristics. "
nervous system diseases,Severe lidocaine intoxication by cutaneous absorption. A severe lidocaine intoxication by cutaneous absorption is described. Data are presented to show a significant absorption of lidocaine through diseased skin when lidocaine cream is used as a local anesthetic. Awareness of this route of intoxication might be important in patients in whom neurologic or psychiatric symptoms develop while large amounts of lidocaine cream are being used. 
nervous system diseases,"Pain management in the orthopedic patient. Pain is a familiar phenomenon to all orthopedic nurses. As Dunwoody said, ""Few things we do for patients are more fundamental to the quality of life than relieving pain."" We as orthopedic nurses are in a position to contribute to the positive management of pain by using a comprehensive approach to pain management that involves the participation of the patient. We need to believe the patient's pain, try new approaches, and help our patients achieve pain relief. "
nervous system diseases,"Delirium: masquerades and misdiagnosis in elderly inpatients. Delirium is an organic mental disorder defined as transient, fluctuating global dysfunction of cognition. It is common in elderly medical inpatients, yet its varied presentation is often missed or misdiagnosed. "
nervous system diseases,"Frontal lobe utilization behavior associated with paramedian thalamic infarction. Disinhibited, exaggerated responses to objects and environmental cues (utilization behavior) occur predominantly with frontal lobe damage. We report a striking example associated with paramedian thalamic infarction suggesting a thalamofrontal component to environmental interactions that require inhibition, self-monitoring, and cognitive flexibility. "
nervous system diseases,Pupil-sparing oculomotor nerve palsy due to midbrain infarction. Vasculopathic oculomotor nerve palsies with pupillary sparing are thought to be due to ischemic damage to the nerve in the subarachnoid space or the cavernous sinus. We present two cases of patients with isolated pupil-sparing oculomotor nerve palsies due to midbrain infarcts. Focal ischemic midbrain lesions should be considered in cases of pupil-sparing oculomotor nerve palsies. 
nervous system diseases,"Vagal schwannoma. A patient with a benign encapsulated intrathoracic vagal schwannoma is presented and the literature is reviewed. The right paratracheal tumor was identified incidentally on a chest film and excised using a right thoracotomy. Although rare, vagal schwannomas should be considered for any mediastinal mass along the vagus nerves especially when the paratracheal tumor produces minimal or no respiratory symptoms suggesting a slow-growing, encapsulated process. "
nervous system diseases,"Sumatriptan in acute migraine: pharmacology and review of world experience. The introduction of sumatriptan, a novel abortive antimigraine agent, has generated a significant amount of preclinical and clinical interest during the past few years. At the scientific level, sumatriptan is unique in terms of its selective pharmacological properties. The effects of sumatriptan in various experimental paradigms have led to new insights into the pathophysiology of migraine. At the clinical level, sumatriptan appears to be an effective abortive anti-migraine agent with minimal side effects. Its ability to decrease, rather than exacerbate, the nausea and vomiting of migraine appears to be an important advance in the treatment of migraine. "
nervous system diseases,Antivenom therapy in Russell's viper bite. Bleeding and renal failure are the two main manifestations responsible for the high morbidity and mortality in untreated Russell's viper bite victims. This study was an effort to find prognostic factors and a practical therapeutic approach for the care of such patients. Early detection of abnormalities in the clot quality test and/or evidence of systemic bleeding followed by immediate correction of the clotting defects using specific antivenom can reduce morbidity in Russell's viper envenomation. 
nervous system diseases,"A single case of Huntington's disease simultaneously occurring with obstructive hydrocephalus. A case of simultaneously occurring Huntington's disease and obstructive hydrocephalus is presented. Huntington's and other neurodegenerative diseases have been described with normal-pressure hydrocephalus; however, no such description with obstructive hydrocephalus has been reported. The obstructive hydrocephalus displays a familial tendency in its presentation. "
nervous system diseases,"Glossopharyngeal schwannoma: review of five cases and the literature. Glossopharyngeal schwannomas are rare tumors in spite of the fact that acoustic schwannomas account for 8%-10% of intracranial tumors. There have been 23 reported cases in the literature. This report of five cases is the largest series of these tumors. The presentation, radiological workup, operation, and long-term postoperative results will be presented, along with a review of the literature. "
nervous system diseases,Acute oculogyric crisis after administration of prochlorperazine. We report a case of acute oculogyric crisis due to prochlorperazine administration in a young black woman with a concomitant viral infection. Neuroleptic medications are the most common cause of drug-induced acute dystonic reactions such as oculogyric crisis. Prochlorperazine is an antiemetic agent with a phenothiazine-type chemical structure and is known to cause dystonic reactions. Drug-induced acute dystonic reactions are most common in young adults and in men. Viral infections may also predispose patients to these adverse reactions. Caution is warranted when this drug is used in patients who have other risk factors for an acute dystonic reaction. 
nervous system diseases,"Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea following acoustic neurinoma surgery. Technical note. The authors describe a method of preventing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea following surgery for acoustic neurinoma. Mastoid air cells exposed during craniectomy are skeletonized and packed with bone dust, then covered with Surgicel soaked with Tisseel fibrin glue. The use of this technique has reduced the number of acoustic neurinoma cases requiring secondary mastoidectomy for CSF leakage from 16% to 5%. "
nervous system diseases,"Treatment of status migrainosus: the American experience. Dependence upon a variety of drugs--ergotamine, analgesics, benzodiazepines, corticosteroids--is a major reason for patients to enter an intractable phase of their migrainous disorders. Repeated dosing of dihydroergotamine has proven to be remarkably effective in stabilizing the mechanism of migraine, allowing these patients to make the transition to a more reasonable as well as more specific form of therapy. "
nervous system diseases,"Characterization of ""peak E,"" a novel amino acid associated with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Epidemiologic studies strongly associate eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) with ingestion of tryptophan containing a contaminant (""peak E""). Prior reports have suggested that peak E is the di-tryptophan N alpha-animal of acetaldehyde. Spectral and chemical studies now demonstrate that peak E is 1,1'-ethylidenebis[tryptophan]. This novel amino acid may be the etiological agent responsible for EMS, or it may be a marker of a still unidentified causal agent. "
nervous system diseases,"Hyponatraemia secondary to an inappropriately high release of antidiuretic hormone in cardiac tamponade. A spontaneous intrapericardial haemorrhage caused cardiac tamponade in a 29 year old paraplegic man who was being treated with warfarin. The associated persistent hyponatraemia, which was believed to be caused by an inappropriately high release of antidiuretic hormone, rapidly resolved after pericardiocentesis. "
nervous system diseases,"Orbital intramuscular schwannoma. In an 8-year-old girl with asymptomatic proptosis, computed tomographic scans showed a large medial orbital mass that contoured the globe anteriorly, bowed the optic nerve laterally, and extended posteriorly to the orbital apex. T1-weighted coronal magnetic resonance images showed the mass to be a diffusely enlarged medial rectus muscle. Histopathologic examination of a medial rectus muscle biopsy specimen disclosed a multinodular, intramuscular schwannoma, separating and infiltrating normal skeletal muscle fibers. The intramuscular location and multinodular configuration of this tumor, together with its occurrence in a child, distinguish it from previous orbital schwannomas. "
nervous system diseases,"The ""numb cheek-limp lower lid"" syndrome. A patient developed isolated numbness, 1st confined to the lateral nose and upper lip, but later involving the cheek, lower lip, upper gingiva, and the palate. This numbness was later associated with paresis of the muscles of the upper lip and angle of the mouth and with ipsilateral lower lid droop (the ""numb cheek-limp lower lid"" syndrome). Squamous cell carcinoma was discovered infiltrating the infraorbital nerve and distal branches of the facial nerve. Cheek numbness associated with lower eyelid or upper lip weakness may herald a neoplasm affecting the infraorbital nerve and distal facial nerve branches. "
nervous system diseases,The treatment of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome by limbic leucotomy. A patient with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome and severe self-injurious compulsions who had failed to respond to drug treatment and behavioural therapy obtained a complete and sustained resolution of his destructive behaviour and improvement in his tics following bilateral limbic leucotomy. 
nervous system diseases,"Meningiomas mimicking cerebral schwannoma. A brain tumor with histological features reminiscent of schwannoma with underlying meningioangiomatosis was subjected to electron microscopic and immunohistochemical analysis, which confirmed the neoplasm as a meningioma. This prompted reexamination of a similar tumor, described in a previous publication as a cerebral schwannoma, with identical immunohistochemical techniques. The results obtained favored alteration of this diagnosis to that of meningioma. This experience has led the authors to recommend the use of immunohistochemistry techniques when evaluating unusual intracranial neoplasms. "
nervous system diseases,"Conditioning of the spinal stretch reflex: implications for rehabilitation. The purpose of this article is to describe a new technique that can potentially be applied to patients with hyperactive spinal stretch reflexes (SSRs). The progression of clinical research from conditioning of individual muscles or muscle groups (electromyographic biofeedback) to conditioning SSRs is explained. Research data from subhuman primates in addition to the first human experiments are reviewed. Potential applications of SSR conditioning are discussed, as are the issues requiring further delineation and research before the specificity of a training effect can be ascertained. "
nervous system diseases,"Myotonic heart disease: a clinical follow-up. We followed 37 patients with myotonic dystrophy for a mean of 6 years. Two developed atrial flutter or fibrillation, 6 developed a new bundle branch block, 1 developed complete heart block requiring a pacemaker, and another with progressive 1st-degree heart block and a widening QRS interval had a sudden death. Most patients had predictable, gradually progressive disease of their cardiac conduction system. We recommend that patients with progressive atrioventricular block or widening QRS interval due to myotonic heart disease have yearly ECGs and be questioned about syncope or presyncope to determine the need for a cardiac pacemaker. "
nervous system diseases,Pseudospasticity in Guillain-Barre syndrome. We report a woman with Guillain-Barre syndrome who developed a flexion posture of the right arm and hand resembling upper motor neuron dysfunction. EMG demonstrated that involuntary peripherally generated continuous motor unit discharges caused the posture. 
nervous system diseases,"Endosalpingosis as a cause of chronic pelvic pain. Endosalpingosis, a condition characterized by ectopic oviduct epithelium, is diagnosed histologically by the appearance of benign ciliated and nonciliated columnar cells in an abnormal location. Endosalpingosis is typically without symptoms. Our unusual case report shows symptomatic endosalpingosis first seen with chronic pelvic pain. Various aspects of this disease will also be discussed. "
nervous system diseases,"Crico-tracheal disruption and common carotid artery occlusion: a case of blunt trauma. A case of blunt trauma to the neck is presented. While driving an all terrain vehicle (ATV), a 20-yr-old male was struck across the anterior neck by a cord suspended between two poles. Initial findings were suggestive of an isolated laryngeal injury; 48 hours later, however, a dense left hemiplegia became manifest. A CT scan demonstrated a large right frontoparietal cerebral infarct, and an angiogram confirmed occlusion of the right common carotid artery. Intractable cerebral oedema developed, and the patient died five days after the initial insult. Such injuries should alert the clinician to the possibility of major vascular injury, and if suspected, angiography is warranted. "
nervous system diseases,Adult peripheral neuroepithelioma in Meckel's cave. A case of peripheral neuroepithelioma arising from the trigeminal nerve in Meckel's cave is presented. The discussion emphasizes the pathological criteria for the diagnosis of a peripheral neuroepithelioma and the current controversy about the classification of this and related tumors. 
nervous system diseases,"An intracranial mass lesion in systemic xanthogranulomatosis: case report. The authors describe a 42-year-old woman with systemic xanthogranulomatosis and bilateral intraorbital tumors, who subsequently developed multiple lesions of the intracranial dura mater, spinal cord, retroperitoneum, pericardium, and mediastinum. Systemic xanthogranulomatosis is histologically similar to systemic Weber-Christian disease, except for the absence of subcutaneous panniculitis. Immunohistochemical studies suggest that this clinical entity can be differentiated from histiocytosis X, because foamy cells in systemic xanthogranulomatosis demonstrate macrophages but not T-zone histiocyte markers. Differentiation of this disease from other intracranial xanthogranulomas and treatment are discussed. "
nervous system diseases,"Chronic headache associated with a functioning shunt: usefulness of pressure monitoring. Chronic headaches in a shunt-dependent patient with small ventricles has long been treated with little or no regard to intracranial pressure. In this study, pressure monitoring on 12 such patients demonstrated that they fell into three distinct categories: 3 had headaches caused by intracranial hypertension, 2 had headaches from hypotension, and 7 showed no relation of symptoms to pressure. As therapeutic procedures for treating these three categories are entirely different and sometimes opposing, it is clear that intracranial pressure monitoring is essential to successful management of this complaint. "
nervous system diseases,"Enveloping the bladder with displacement of flap of the rectus abdominis muscle for the treatment of neurogenic bladder. Neurogenic bladder is a frequent occurrence. A new surgical technique has been designed and was used successfully in 18 patients with ideal results. The key point of the operation is to turn over a flap of rectus abdominis muscle to envelop the bladder. Contraction of the muscle flap and the abdominal muscles would enhance voiding ability. In the meantime, the bladder is displaced forward and the resultant change in the bladder-posterior urethral angle also favors voiding. Since the bladder is near the anterior abdominal wall manual compression during voiding is made easier. All of these advantages greatly facilitate voiding. "
nervous system diseases,"Myelopathic neurosarcoidosis: diagnostic value of enhanced MRI. Neurosarcoidosis is an underdiagnosed variant of the systemic disease. We report a case of myelopathic neurosarcoidosis, noting the contribution made by MRI in establishing the diagnosis, and we discuss the possibility that the disease is differentially responsive to various steroid formulations. "
nervous system diseases,"A surgical approach to the cervicothoracic spine. We describe a method for approaching the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine, the brachial plexus and related vessels. The method involves the elevation of the medial corner of the manubrium, the sternoclavicular joint, and the medial half of the clavicle on a pedicle of the sternomastoid muscle. We have used this exposure in 17 cases with few complications and good results. Its successful performance requires high standards of anaesthesia, surgical technique and postoperative care. "
nervous system diseases,"Oculo-bulbar myasthenic symptoms as the sole sign of tumour involving or compressing the brain stem. Four patients with tumours involving or compressing the brain stem are described whose initial clinical symptoms of fluctuating paresis of the external ocular muscles and/or the pharyngeal muscles without other neurological deficits led to the primary diagnosis of focal myasthenia. The combination of an unusual clinical pattern, involvement of muscles of only one ocular nerve or severe dysphagia/dysarthria without extension of the myasthenic symptoms, should lead to further investigation to exclude other reasons of a focal myasthenic syndrome such as a brain-stem tumour. "
nervous system diseases,"Synchronous Hodgkin's disease and myelofibrosis terminating with granulocytic sarcoma and acute megakaryocytic leukemia. Our patient had stage IIIAI Hodgkin's disease with synchronous myelofibrosis and myeloid metaplasia. A slowly progressive myeloproliferative disease developed over 9 1/2 years and terminated in a painful osteolytic bone disease, spinal extradural granulocytic sarcoma and acute megakaryocytic leukemia. It is likely that this was a result of the myeloproliferative disease rather than a late complication from combination chemotherapy. Our case demonstrates the importance of a curative approach to Hodgkin's disease even in the face of a coexistent disease with a long or unknown natural history. "
nervous system diseases,"Concomitant neurocysticercosis and brucellosis. A young Mexican woman had headache and left arm weakness develop shortly after immigrating to the United States. A solitary cerebral cysticercus was found at surgery, but, instead of the expected finding of clear fluid, the cyst contained pus from which Brucella melitensis was cultured. Although the patient had no signs or symptoms suggestive of brucellosis, agglutination studies revealed IgM and IgG antibodies consistent with active brucellosis. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of multiple infections in immigrants from countries where parasites and bacteria that are uncommon in the United States are endemic. "
nervous system diseases,"An eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with an L-tryptophan containing product. A syndrome of eosinophilia and myalgias associated with the usage of L-tryptophan containing products has been recently described by the Centers for Disease Control. We report a case of this new clinical entity, highlighted by severe myositis, and compare this illness with similar reported syndromes. "
nervous system diseases,"Magnetic resonance in pediatric and adolescent neuroimaging. With improved availability and a practical understanding of the principles of utilization, MRI will continue to replace CT and US in pediatric neuroimaging, just as it has impacted upon the more invasive modalities. In general, US remains the procedure of choice for screening of fetal and infant CNS abnormalities, and CT continues as the principal screening modality beyond infancy and especially for acute, emergent presentations. MRI has now emerged as a primary option for screening as well as for more definitive assessment of many intracranial and most intraspinal conditions. "
nervous system diseases,"Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome in association with L-tryptophan ingestion. The association between the recently described eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and L-tryptophan is now well established. We describe a patient with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome who developed incapacitating myalgias and peripheral eosinophilia responsive only to high dose corticosteroids. When massive upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage developed while receiving corticosteroid therapy, surgery was complicated by striking abdominal wall rigidness. A discussion of this case and of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome is presented. "
nervous system diseases,"Developmental dysmnesia in a poor reader. A 22-yr-old subject with moderate developmental dyslexia experienced poor memory from an early age. In spite of normal intelligence he had great difficulty in learning historical and geographical names, mathematical formulae, poems and songs, and verbal series such as the letters of the alphabet and the months of the year. His recognition of familiar faces was also faulty at times. A battery of memory tests confirmed a moderate deficit of verbal as well as visual memory, whereas spatial memory was preserved. Other cognitive functions were intact, except for a mild reading disability. No evidence of brain pathology was provided by his history, neurological examination and CT scanning. "
nervous system diseases,"Paraesthesia with lumbar epidural catheters. A comparison of air and saline in a loss-of-resistance technique. The epidural space was located in 32 obstetric patients using loss of resistance to air, while in a further 35 saline was used. The incidence of paraesthesia was 56% in the air group and 57% in the saline group. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of other complications or in the quality of analgesia provided. "
nervous system diseases,"Spinal cord injury after subclavian flap aortoplasty. An experimental study in piglets. Paraplegia is a rare but much feared complication of corrective surgery for coarctation of the aorta. The problem was studied in 31 newborn pigs submitted to subclavian flap aortoplasty. The aortic cross-clamping time ranged from 9-25 min. Twenty-three piglets with clamping times 9-18 min were neurologically intact, whereas eight with aortic clamping for 18-25 min became paraplegic. The clinical implications for newborn children with symptomatic aortic coarctation are discussed with regard to these experimental findings. "
nervous system diseases,Correlation between essential tremor and migraine headache. The relationship between essential tremor (ET) and migraine was investigated in a prospective study. In a group of 74 ET patients 36.5% had migraine compared with 17.7% of 102 control subjects without tremor. In a group of 58 patients with migraine 17.2% had ET compared with 1.2% of 85 controls without migraine. The prevalence of ET in migraine controls was greater than controls without migraine (22% compared with 1%; p = 0.002). It is concluded that there is an association between essential tremor and migraine. 
nervous system diseases,"Recurrence of acoustic neurilemoma as a malignant spindle-cell neoplasm. Case report. A 75-year-old man presented with a right cerebellopontine angle tumor 11 months after complete macroscopic resection of a right acoustic neurilemoma. Histological examination of the recurrent tumor showed a malignant spindle-cell neoplasm with positive staining for S-100 protein. The patient had no stigmata of von Recklinghausen's disease. It is proposed that this recurrence represents progression from a benign to a malignant acoustic nerve-sheath tumor, an event that is extremely rare outside the clinicopathological context of neurofibromatosis. "
nervous system diseases,"Timing of osteosynthesis of major fractures in patients with severe brain injury. A retrospective study was performed to assess the effects on outcome of early osteosynthesis of major extremity fractures in patients with severe brain injury (GCS less than or equal to 7). In a consecutive series of 58 patients, early osteosynthesis was performed on the day of injury in 15 patients. (Group A). In 43 patients no major fractures were present or no early osteosynthesis was performed (Group B). The severity of brain injury as seen on CT scan was similar in both groups. Mortality was significantly lower in Group A, despite a significantly higher ISS. As to the functional end result of brain injury, an indication of a better outcome was present in Group A. "
nervous system diseases,"Wide cavum septum pellucidum: a marker of disturbed brain development. A wide cavum septum pellucidum defined as a separation of greater than 1 cm of the leaves occurs uncommonly. Nine children with wide cavum septum pellucidum were studied; 8 were abnormal. Observed abnormalities included cognitive impairment (8), seizures (4), hypoplasia of the corpus callosum (4), optic nerve hypoplasia (2), and growth failure (4). The incidence of intellectual dysfunction, the association with midline anomalies of the brain, and growth failure all suggest that wide cavum septum pellucidum may represent part of a spectrum of midline brain anomalies. "
nervous system diseases,"Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening: further consideration of low-volume testing. Unrecognized assay drift that may occur during low-volume (fewer than 500 specimens per week) maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein testing could result in either underestimation or overestimation of the number of pregnant women who are at increased risk of fetal malformations and genetic anomalies. Quality control software programs that incorporate the use of a multirule Shewhart chart are designed to detect assay drift. Careful selection of quality control sera for inclusion in analytic assays and appropriate application of a multirule quality control procedure to values that are obtained on these control materials should detect assay drift, regardless of the volume of patients' specimens in the run. "
nervous system diseases,"Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (L-tryptophan-associated neuromyopathy). Histopathologic study of skeletal muscle biopsy in a patient with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome following L-tryptophan use showed prominent lymphocytic perineuritis, neuritis, and perimysial fasciitis. The presence of perineuritis and neuritis provides a histopathologic basis for clinical features of neuropathy in eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and occurred in conjunction with a fasciitis or interstitial myositis that was predominantly perimysial and focally endomysial. "
nervous system diseases,The UCLA-University of Utah epidemiologic survey of autism: the etiologic role of rare diseases. Twelve rare diseases known to cause CNS pathology were found in 26 (11%) of 233 autistic probands identified during a recent epidemiologic survey of Utah. These 26 probands had significantly lower mean IQs than the remaining patients (43 versus 60) but similar sex distribution and prevalence of abnormal EEGs and seizures. The rarity and diversity of these 12 diseases make it highly unlikely that they randomly occurred with autism. Their presence in this epidemiologic survey is the most compelling evidence to date to support the hypothesis that different diseases producing different types of CNS pathology can play an etiologic role in autism. 
nervous system diseases,"Attitudes of major employers toward the employment of people with epilepsy: a 30-year study. Beginning in 1956, major San Francisco Bay area employers were sampled at 10-year intervals for a 30-year period to assess attitudes toward the employment of epileptic workers. In this time, we documented a trend of sustained positive change that appears to validate the efforts of organizations that have focused on raising public awareness of this disorder. "
nervous system diseases,"Cosmetic, functional, independent: self-help aids. Self-help orthotics have been developed to assist functional activities for high-level spinal cord injured patients. The goal of rehabilitation has been to do this with as little intrusion on independence and cosmesis as possible. This paper describes devices to help a patient with C6 quadriplegia independently place his own utensils and eat with an almost normal appearance. The new self-help aids are made from standard silverware, a rivet, and two one-eighth-inch Kydex loops. The loops are riveted centrally on the utensil, allowing for free rotation. The device was evaluated on a patient with C6, complete quadriplegia. The subject demonstrated independence in donning and doffing the device and in eating with an almost normal appearance. "
nervous system diseases,"Why are autism and the fragile-X syndrome associated? Conceptual and methodological issues. Investigations of the association between autism and the fragile-X syndrome have yielded conflicting results with some studies indicating a strong correlation and others indicating no relation between the disorders. In this paper, we review the relevant research on this controversy and discuss the conceptual and methodological problems involved in such an inquiry. We conclude that autism and fragile X are associated and that this relation will prove fruitful in understanding the role of the X chromosome in a variety of behavior disorders and in unraveling various theoretical accounts on the etiology of autism. "
nervous system diseases,Cardiac arrhythmias from a malpositioned Greenfield filter in a traumatic quadriplegic. A case study is presented of premature Greenfield filter discharge with intracardiac migration and resulting life-threatening arrhythmias. These arrhythmias also interfered with the patient's transition from ventilatory support via orotracheal intubation to noninvasive positive airway pressure ventilatory support methods. The patient's arrhythmias were controlled by a demand cardiac pacemaker and cardiac glycoside therapy. No anticoagulants were used. She had no further filter migration nor significant complications for 16 months after hospital discharge. 
nervous system diseases,"Hip pain in late pregnancy. Hip pain in late pregnancy is quite common, and its etiology is rarely established unless acute demineralization occurs. We measured the bone mineral content of both hips in 26 women within 48 hours of delivery. Twelve of 36 densities (33%) were decreased in a group with severe pain when compared to 12 of 120 decreased densities (10%) in the remaining patients (P less than .05). Those data suggest that severe hip pain may be related to a decrease in bone mineral content. "
nervous system diseases,"A review of techniques employed to estimate the number of motor units in a muscle. Being the smallest functional units under neural control, motor units play an integral role in muscle physiology. However, at the present time, there does not exist any widely accepted technique for quantifying or estimating the number of motor units in a muscle. Specifically, the existing techniques are the increment-counting technique, a technique based on spike-triggered averaging, and a macro-EMG based technique which vary in invasiveness from noninvasive to highly invasive, respectively. We discuss each of these techniques, along with their associated shortcomings, in detail. "
nervous system diseases,"Antibodies to synthetic peptide (125-148) of the alpha-subunit of human nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in sera from patients with myasthenia gravis. We measured the amount of antibodies to a synthetic peptide that corresponds to the alpha-subunit residues Lys125-Thr148 of human acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in myasthenic sera. We detected anti-peptide antibodies in 52% (89/171) of the patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), but none in any of the healthy controls. Anti-peptide antibodies should provide a valuable immunologic parameter for the clinical evaluation of MG, but no apparent correlation was observed between the titers of anti-peptide and anti-AChR antibodies. "
nervous system diseases,"Postural hypotension: pressor effect of octreotide not mediated by norepinephrine. Orthostatic hypotension of the Shy-Drager syndrome is a chronic incapacitating condition characterized by lack of an appropriate increase in the plasma norepinephrine level in response to standing. Recently, the somatostatin analogue octreotide has been reported to induce a pressor response in patients having this syndrome. We have reported a case of Shy-Drager syndrome in which octreotide was effective, but the rise in blood pressure was not accompanied by an increase in the plasma norepinephrine level. Hence, the pressor effect of octreotide is not mediated by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, but probably through splanchnic vasoconstriction. "
nervous system diseases,"Miller-Fisher syndrome and pontine abnormalities on MRI: a case report. The authors report a patient with Miller-Fisher syndrome in whom MRI of the brain stem showed increased signal density on T2 sequence anterior to the fourth ventricle, on the right and the left. The authors discuss the relation between these MRI abnormalities and some clinical features of the syndrome. The authors believe that the cardinal features of Miller-Fisher syndrome are due to peripheral nervous system dysfunction, but that this does not preclude a possible central nervous system involvement. "
nervous system diseases,Magnetic resonance imaging for ineffectual tarsal tunnel surgical treatment. Tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS) is an entrapment neuropathy caused by compression of the posterior tibial nerve beneath the ankle flexor retinaculum. Treatment of TTS consists of surgical release of the retinaculum. The failure rate is 10%-20%. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was used to evaluate a patient with an unsatisfactory response. MR imaging demonstrated incompleteness of the surgical release of the flexor retinaculum. 
nervous system diseases,"Benign intracranial hypertension after ciprofloxacin administration. Many drugs, including antibiotics, have been implicated in the aetiology of benign intracranial hypertension. We report the development of benign intracranial hypertension after the use of ciprofloxacin in a teenager with cystic fibrosis. "
nervous system diseases,"Unilateral hydrocephalus in adults. The authors report 14 cases of unilateral hydrocephalus in adults. Headache was the most common presenting symptom. Unilateral hydrocephalus was documented in each patient with computed tomography scans; magnetic resonance imaging was also used in seven patients in the latter part of the series. Unilateral hydrocephalus was caused by tumor (seven patients), venous angioma (one patient), ependymal cyst (one patient), postinflammatory gliosis (one patient), and was idiopathic in four patients. The primary surgical treatment was craniotomy with fenestration of the septum pellucidum, which relieved symptoms in eight of nine patients for whom long-term follow-up data were available. "
nervous system diseases,"Laparoscopic ventrosuspensions. A review of 72 cases. Laparoscopic ventrosuspension is simple to perform after diagnostic laparoscopy. Serious postoperative complication is unlikely. However, patient follow-up over 6 months has not confirmed the usefulness of laparoscopic ventrosuspension in the management of deep dyspareunia or pelvic pain in association with a retroverted uterus. The success rate of laparoscopic ventrosuspension at 6 months varies from 18.6% to 46.5%. The prior use of a Hodge pessary does not predict the success of laparoscopic ventrosuspension. "
nervous system diseases,"Diffuse axonal injury: analysis of 100 patients with radiological signs. One hundred patients with head injuries who showed diffuse axonal injury on computed tomographic scans are reported. Evaluation of the Glasgow Coma Score, pupillary signs, and computed tomographic findings on admission led to an improved ability to forecast outcomes. Our relatively good results as compared with other series, can be explained by the high proportion of children and by the liberal use of computed tomography to evaluate head injuries, thus revealing that concussion may sometimes be regarded as an early form of diffuse axonal injury. "
nervous system diseases,"When epilepsy masquerades as heart disease. Awareness is key to avoiding misdiagnosis. Autonomic neural impulses that accompany discharges during a seizure can cause a variety of cardiac manifestations, including cardiac arrhythmias, sudden death, anginal chest pain, neurogenic pulmonary edema, and symptoms of pheochromocytoma. Either generalized or focal seizures may generate such signs and symptoms. A better appreciation of cardiac problems caused by epilepsy is helpful in preventing misdiagnosis, because the clinical picture in such a patient may be confusing. "
nervous system diseases,Intradural epithelial cyst at the craniovertebral junction. Case report. A case of an intradural epithelial cyst at the craniovertebral junction is reported in a 37-year-old man. The classification of these rare lesions is discussed. 
nervous system diseases,"Infantile CNS spongy degeneration--14 cases: clinical update. We studied 14 Arab infants with infantile spongy degeneration, 13 of whom were products of consanguineous marriages. They presented in infancy with macrocephaly, poor visual behavior or blindness, and axial hypotonia with appendicular spasticity. Brain CT and MRI showed diffuse symmetric leukoencephalopathy, even before neurologic symptoms. There were relatively normal EEGs. The visual evoked responses (P100) were either absent or delayed early in the course. The brainstem auditory evoked responses showed milder abnormalities, with loss of later components before the earlier ones. Deficient aspartoacylase activity in cultured fibroblasts or brain biopsy confirmed the diagnosis in all patients. "
nervous system diseases,"A multifocal schwannoma of the masseteric nerve causing hemicrania. A case is reported of schwannoma of the right masseteric nerve, invading the pterygopalatine fossa and the parapharyngeal space through the mandibular notch in a 61-year-old woman. The tumor in this case was composed of four various-sized interconnected nodules, simulating a string of beads. The tumor was the cause of the patient's chronic hemicrania, as confirmed by the relief from and disappearance of head pain after surgical removal of the tumor. The most important aspects of this case are the anatomic site of the schwannoma and its uncommon clinicopathologic manifestations; this tumor originated from the masseteric nerve and is the first case reported to straddle the mandibular notch. "
nervous system diseases,Solitary dorsal intramedullary schwannoma. Case report. A case of solitary dorsal intramedullary schwannoma diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging and treated surgically is reported. The authors review the previously published cases. The possible etiology of the tumor as well as some difficulties encountered in the diagnostic procedure and treatment are discussed. 
nervous system diseases,"Delayed hearing loss after neurovascular decompression. We report two unusual cases of delayed hearing loss after neurovascular decompression of structures within the cerebellopontine angle. In the first case, the patient noted a unilateral hearing loss 3 weeks after undergoing vascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve for tic douloureux. This gradually improved over an 18-month period. In the second case, the patient awoke on the 4th day after vascular decompression of the facial nerve for hemifacial spasm with a bilateral hearing loss that has remained unchanged after the onset. These are examples of delayed acoustic dysfunction occurring with a shift in surgically freed vessels and may have been induced by newly directed neurovascular compression or distortion. "
nervous system diseases,"The deja vu experience: remembrance of things past? The deja vu experience is a common phenomenon, occurring in pathological as well as nonpathological conditions. It has been defined as any subjectively inappropriate impression of familiarity of a present experience with an undefined past. The authors discuss the epidemiologic data, clinical features, and etiology of the phenomenon of deja vu. They also review the different hypotheses on the psychopathogenesis of the deja vu experience and introduce an explanation based on the hologram as a mnestic model. "
nervous system diseases,The induction dose of propofol in infants 1-6 months of age and in children 10-16 years of age. The propofol dose needed for satisfactory induction of anesthesia was determined in 22 infants 1-6 months of age and 22 children 10-16 yr of age. A single bolus of propofol was given over 10 s. Thirty seconds after injection the lid reflex was tested and the anesthesia mask was applied. The patient was considered to be asleep if there were no gross movements during the next 30 s while the patient breathed O2. The dose required for satisfactory induction in 50% of patients (ED50) (+/- SE) was 3.0 +/- 0.2 mg/kg in infants and 2.4 +/- 0.1 mg/kg in older children (P less than 0.02). Pain on injection occurred in 50% of the infants and 18% of the children. 
nervous system diseases,"Platelet monoamine oxidase B activity in parkinsonian patients. Monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) plays a pivotal role in N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induced Parkinsonism. An increased MAO B activity in platelets of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is reported in this study. The possibility that high MAO B activity may represent a trait of vulnerability for PD by enhancing the neurotoxic effects of environmental compounds is discussed. "
nervous system diseases,"No confirmation of visual evoked potential diagnostic test for migraine. We have attempted to replicate the results of studies on a diagnostic test reported to have 90% sensitivity and 89-96% specificity for migraine. The technique is based on peak-to-peak measurements of fast background electroencephalographic activity during a visual evoked potential (VEP) study. VEP latencies and amplitudes did not differ significantly, and showed substantial overlap, between a group of eight migraine patients and ten age-matched healthy controls. We could not recognise previously described fast activity or measure it objectively by peak-to-peak measurements. We cannot confirm that measurement of fast wave activity in the VEP background is useful in diagnosis of migraine. "
nervous system diseases,"Presentation and management of an acute caffeine overdose. A one-year-old white female ingested approximately two to three grams of caffeine (200-300 mg/kg). The patient survived the ingestion with a maximum caffeine concentration of 385 micrograms/ml four hours postingestion. The child developed ventricular arrhythmias, seizures, metabolic disturbances, and severe pulmonary edema. She survived without apparent long-term sequelae despite having reached a serum caffeine concentration that is the second highest reported level in a survivor. "
nervous system diseases,"Long-term follow-up of the use of nonporous hydroxyapatite for augmentation of the alveolar ridge. Particulate hydroxyapatite (HA) was used in the augmentation of 18 mandibular and four maxillary ridges in 21 patients whose cases were followed postoperatively for 5 to 7 years. Patients were evaluated clinically, radiographically, and through questionnaires. Prosthodontic assessment of retention and stability of dentures showed improvement 5 years postoperatively. Patients receiving HA rated their dentures favorably using parameters of the Cornell Medical Index. The results of this study show that particulate HA alone can be used as a satisfactory material for augmentation of the alveolar ridge. "
nervous system diseases,"The dynamic flexometer: an instrument for the objective evaluation of spasticity. Anesthesiologists may care for patients who have spasticity in the operating room or pain clinic. A number of therapeutic modalities for treatment of spasticity exist, but there are few simple objective methods for evaluating their effect. We describe one instrument, the Dynamic Flexometer, that measures the force required to move the limb passively through its maximum range of motion. The data presented validate the instrument's reliability. Two clinical cases presented here demonstrate the instrument's utility. This device may be of value to anesthesiologists involved in the care of patients with spasticity. "
nervous system diseases,"Angiographic changes suggestive of vasospasm in migraine complicated by stroke. A 30-year-old woman with a history of common migraine developed a permanent left homonymous hemianopia during a typical headache. CT scan demonstrated a right posterior cerebral infarction and angiography showed irregular narrowing of the ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery, suggestive of vasospasm. In the case no risk factors for atherosclerotic stroke were present except for smoking, and no other causes of stroke could be found. "
nervous system diseases,"Multiple representations of pain in human cerebral cortex. The representation of pain in the cerebral cortex is less well understood than that of any other sensory system. However, with the use of magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography in humans, it has now been demonstrated that painful heat causes significant activation of the contralateral anterior cingulate, secondary somatosensory, and primary somatosensory cortices. This contrasts with the predominant activation of primary somatosensory cortex caused by vibrotactile stimuli in similar experiments. Furthermore, the unilateral cingulate activation indicates that this forebrain area, thought to regulate emotions, contains an unexpectedly specific representation of pain. "
nervous system diseases,"Haemorrhagic shock encephalopathy and sudden infant death In 2 pairs of non-identical twins, haemorrhagic-shock encephalopathy syndrome developed in 1 co-twin while the other died of sudden infant death syndrome. The twin pairs were aged 3 and 4 months, respectively, and no cause was identified. We suggest that stress protein deficiency may underlie both syndromes. "
nervous system diseases,"Familial hypobetalipoproteinaemia complicated by cerebellar ataxia and steatocystoma multiplex. A 55-year-old man with cerebellar ataxia and steatocystoma multiplex was found to have reduced serum concentrations of total cholesterol, betalipoprotein and apolipoprotein B. Computed tomography revealed atrophy of the cerebellum and brain stem. Of the six family members examined, four had hypobetalipoproteinaemia, and one had mild ataxia. Similar skin lesions were noted in five male relatives. This case represents a rare combination of familial hypobetalipoproteinaemia, cerebellar ataxia and steatocystoma multiplex. "
nervous system diseases,"A unique indexing splint for use in combined Le Fort and nasal injuries to avoid tracheostomy. Midface fractures with associated displaced and/or comminuted nasal fractures can require tracheostomy for a general anesthetic airway if these fractures are to be reduced simultaneously. We describe a unique indexing splint that allows oral intubation yet also allows simultaneous reduction of midface and nasal fractures under one anesthetic. Furthermore, tracheostomy with its potential complications is avoided. The case report illustrates the technique, and alternative treatments for these injuries are discussed. "
nervous system diseases,"Bicarbonate-buffered lidocaine-epinephrine-hyaluronidase for eyelid anesthesia. A double-masked, randomized clinical trial was conducted to determine if subcutaneous eyelid injections of a bicarbonate-buffered lidocaine-epinephrine-hyaluronidase mixture were less painful than unbuffered injections. Twenty-one patients received both buffered (pH = 7.4) and unbuffered (pH = 4.6) injections. After each injection, patients recorded pain on a scale of 0, ""no pain,"" to 10, ""severe pain."" Mean pain score for buffered injections was 2.0 versus 4.1 for unbuffered injections (P = 0.0003). Seventeen (81%) of 21 patients ranked the buffered injection less painful. Use of a bicarbonate-buffered lidocaine-epinephrine-hyaluronidase mixture is effective in making ophthalmic anesthesia less painful. "
nervous system diseases,Measurement and treatment in cerebral palsy: an argument for a new approach. This article describes the need for a shift in our therapeutic strategies for patients with cerebral palsy. Changes in functional abilities must be stressed in therapy. Coincident with this emphasis must be the development of functional assessments to be used when documenting intervention outcomes. Research on functional arm movement using kinematic analysis is described for this patient group. 
nervous system diseases,"Cat-scratch disease: an unusual cause of combative behavior. Acute encephalitis is an unusual manifestation of cat-scratch disease. The authors present the case of a 27-year-old man who exhibited the acute onset of encephalitis manifested by violent behavior and confusion. The diagnosis of drug abuse was presumed initially, but a careful examination revealed the true cause to be cat-scratch disease. Emergency physicians are frequently faced with the challenging task of evaluating confused and combative patients. This case demonstrates the importance of a complete physical examination and a thorough laboratory evaluation. "
nervous system diseases,"Special considerations for research with pharmacologic agents. As physical medicine and rehabilitation becomes more and more complicated, the medical rehabilitation research teams are often bewildered by the sweeping changes occurring in the application of therapeutic drugs for rehabilitation. Society, through the instrument of governmental regulations, dictates that all new treatments must be efficacious before ""release."". "
nervous system diseases,"Transcranial stab wounds: morbidity and medicolegal awareness. In this series of eight patients with transcranial stab wounds, the importance of classifications of such wounds as a separate traumatic entity is stressed. The mechanisms of neuronal and vascular damage in these wounds are discussed and are found to be specific from other head injuries. Cerebral injury by stabbing is largely restricted to the wound tract. Frontal stabs (two cases) are accompanied by the least morbidity and mortality, while temporal stabs (four cases) are more commonly fatal. In transorbital stabs (two cases) carotid-cavernous fistulae resulted. Early recognition, administration of antitetanus serum and antibiotics, and debridement may minimize complications. "
nervous system diseases,"Open depressed skull fracture missed on computed tomography: a case report. A case of an open depressed skull fracture that was missed on standard computed tomographic (CT) scan is presented. The fracture was seen on a CT generated lateral scout film, and after repositioning the gantry, further CT images clearly showed the fracture and underlying brain injury. The authors recommend that all patients with head trauma undergoing head CT have either a CT generated lateral scout film or a lateral skull radiograph to assess the vertex of the skull, an area poorly visualized on standard axial images. "
nervous system diseases,"A practical approach to the painful bladder syndrome. The painful bladder syndrome (PBS) is a progressive and painful disease of the bladder that may lead to fibrosis, contracture and reduction of bladder capacity. The usual symptoms are urinary urgency, frequency, nocturia, chronic pelvic pain and lower abdominal pain upon filling of the bladder. A retrospective analysis was performed on 21 women with PBS between March 1987 and March 1988. The patients were treated weekly with a bladder pillar block, bladder distention and dimethyl sulfoxide instillation. Symptomatic relief was observed in 80% of the patients so treated. The maximum bladder volume increased from 185 to 475 mL (P less than .01). The side effects were minimal. "
nervous system diseases,"Enterogenous cyst of the cerebellopontine angle cistern: case report. A case of an enterogenous cyst located in the cerebellopontine angle cistern is presented. These cysts have usually been found in the spinal canal, and their intracranial occurrence is exceptional. In the present case, the cyst was lined histologically by a single epithelial layer of cuboidal cells with some glandular structures resembling the fundic glands of the stomach. The unusual location of the cyst and its histological features are discussed. "
nervous system diseases,"Granulocytic sarcoma presenting as an epidural mass with acute paraparesis in an aleukemic patient. Granulocytic sarcomas are rare tumors composed of granulocytic precursor cells. They are most commonly encountered in patients with acute myelogenous leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders in blast crisis. Rarely, patients presenting with granulocytic sarcoma show no evidence of acute leukemia. The authors report an aleukemic patient with acute paraparesis from an epidural granulocytic sarcoma. Only five such cases have been reported previously. Immunoperoxidase stain for lysozyme and chloroacetate esterase stain were used to prove the myeloid origin of the tumor cells. "
nervous system diseases,"Horner's syndrome from hypothalamic infarction. We report a case of Horner's syndrome due to ipsilateral posterior hypothalamic infarction, occurring in the absence of other signs of hypothalamic dysfunction. Associated symptoms of contralateral faciobrachial weakness and dysarthria correlated with the extension of the infarct into the posterior limb of the internal capsule seen by magnetic resonance imaging. The likely vascular anatomy of this lesion is discussed. "
nervous system diseases,"Acquired childhood aphasia. Outcome 1 year after onset. The effects of the variables age at onset, cause, severity and bilaterality of lesion, and type of aphasia on course and outcome were investigated in a group of 28 aphasic children. Analysis of spontaneous speech and tests of auditory verbal comprehension were used to determine the presence of aphasia. The severity of the cerebral lesion was assessed using a rating scale for computed tomographic scans. Most of the children had not recovered completely 1 year after onset. Recovery was significantly different according to etiological categories. Complete recovery was seen in the majority of traumatic cases. "
nervous system diseases,"Otogenic Fusobacterium necrophorum meningitis. A case of meningitis secondary to acute suppurative otitis media in a previously healthy child is reported. The only organism isolated from blood after aerobic and prolonged anaerobic culture was identified as Fusobacterium necrophorum. Complete recovery followed treatment with surgery and prolonged antibiotic therapy. The role of anaerobes in the development of meningitis, the isolation and identification of Fusobacterium necrophorum, the clinical presentations of F. necrophorum infection and the choice of antibiotics in the treatment of these infections are discussed. "
nervous system diseases,"Corticosteroid-responsive dominantly inherited neuropathy in childhood. We describe three children with corticosteroid-responsive inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy from families with dominantly inherited neuropathy. There were atypical clinical, electrophysiologic, and pathologic characteristics that suggested a coexistent inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy and that should alert the clinician to the possibility of an associated acquired, potentially treatable disorder. "
nervous system diseases,"The TURP syndrome. This article discusses the presentation, aetiology, treatment and prevention of central nervous system disturbances after transurethral resection of the prostate. Nausea and vomiting, visual symptoms, and altered states of consciousness have been reported as complications due to intravascular absorption of irrigating fluid. Hypotonicity after absorption of the irrigating fluid causes cerebral oedema. Hyperglycinaemia may cause visual disturbances and hyperammonaemia may cause delayed coma. "
nervous system diseases,"Reference values for the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in octo- and nonagenarians The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used in a population survey of all inhabitants of Leiden, the Netherlands, over 85 years (n = 1258). In this paper we report on 532 subjects without neurological or psychiatric disease. Results show that the median score and lowest quartile cut-off score remain high until the tenth decade (median score = 28, lowest quartile cut-off score = 26). Thus age, in itself, is not a major limitation in using the MMSE. In this study a comparatively low level of education (the majority had 6 to 7 years of education) did not affect the results on the MMSE in a negative way, nor did we find an association with the use of psychoactive drugs. "
nervous system diseases,"Initial CT findings in 753 patients with severe head injury. A report from the NIH Traumatic Coma Data Bank. In this prospective multicenter study, the authors have examined data derived from the initial computerized tomography (CT) scans of 753 patients with severe head injury. When the CT findings were related to abnormal intracranial pressure and to death, the most important characteristics of the scans were: midline shift: compression or obliteration of the mesencephalic cisterns: and the presence of subarachnoid blood. Diffuse hemispheric swelling was also found to be associated with an early episode of either hypoxia or hypotension. "
nervous system diseases,"Intraoperative ultrasonography: an important surgical adjunct for intramedullary tumors. The echographic characteristics of 186 suspected intramedullary spinal cord tumors were reviewed. Ultrasonography was found to be specific in distinguishing the tumor type, the extent of the lesion, and the presence and type of associated cysts. Ultrasonography greatly facilitates the selection of respective sites for the placement of a myelotomy, and for initiation of the resection. Additionally, this indispensable adjunct provides ongoing images that allow the preoperative plan to be precisely followed in a surgical field where anatomical landmarks are limited and the margin for error is minimal. "
nervous system diseases,"Spinal cord compression with paraplegia in xanthomatosis due to normocholesterolemic sitosterolemia. A 48-year-old woman with a 30-year history of tendinous xanthomatosis developed paraplegia. The magnetic resonance image revealed extramedullary tumors. The analysis of her sera and tumors revealed increased amount of plant sterols, especially sitosterol, and the diagnosis of sitosterolemia was made. This is the first reported case of a patient with sitosterolemia who had the neurological complication of spinal cord compression due to extramedullary sitosterolemic xanthomas. "
nervous system diseases,"Early-onset autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa with severe hyperopia. We studied a four-generation family with early-onset autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, severe hyperopia, and axial eye lengths of less than 20 mm. The affected members had decreased vision, night blindness, typical peripheral retinal pigmentary changes, and electroretinographic abnormalities characteristic of retinitis pigmentosa. This pedigree suggests there is another variant of retinitis pigmentosa associated with hyperopia besides Leber's congenital amaurosis and preserved para-arteriole retinal pigment epithelium. "
nervous system diseases,"Comparison of functional and structural brain disturbances in Wilson's disease. We assessed the functional and structural brain disturbances in Wilson's disease (WD) by evoked potentials (EPs) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All the 25 neurologically symptomatic and 44% of the 16 asymptomatic patients, assessed by both EPs (n = 48) and imaging (n = 41), had at least 1 abnormality of either prolonged EP conduction times, imaging-outlined presence of cerebral lesions, or brain atrophy. Our findings indicate that EPs and MRI are sensitive techniques for the evaluation of brain involvement in WD. "
nervous system diseases,"Acetylsalicylic acid vs. metoprolol in migraine prophylaxis--a double-blind cross-over study. In a double blind cross-over study, 28 patients, 5 male and 23 female, aged 31 +/- 14 years, after a run-in period of 8 weeks, were treated for 3 months with acetylsalicylic acid and for another 3 months with metoprolol, both in a prophylactic mode. Attack frequency was reduced significantly with both therapeutic regimens (ASA p less than 0.001, metoprolol p less than 0.00005). Reduction of attacks below 50% was seen with metoprolol in 14 cases, and with ASA in three cases. Even though ASA was of statistically significant efficacy in migraine prophylaxis, it clearly is not the drug of first choice in migraine prophylaxis. "
nervous system diseases,"The painful shoulder: Part II. Intrinsic disorders and impingement syndrome. Intrinsic disorders that can cause shoulder pain include arthritis, gout, pseudogout and osteonecrosis. In its mildest form, impingement syndrome may cause only minimal discomfort. At its worst, impingement syndrome may lead to rotator cuff tear. Bicipital tendinitis and rupture of the biceps tendon may also be associated with impingement. Early rehabilitative intervention is important. Physical therapy is directed toward restoring range of motion and muscle strength. "
nervous system diseases,HMPAO-SPECT imaging resembling Alzheimer-type dementia in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain using hexamethyl propylene amine oxime (HMPAO) was performed in a 37-year-old patient suffering from mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Reduced blood flow was observed bilaterally in the parieto-occipital regions (resembling Alzheimer type dementia) and in the right parietal lobe. 
nervous system diseases,"Pneumocephalus secondary to a high-pressure water injury to the nose. We report a case of pneumocephalus following a water jet injury to the nose incurred during a water-skiing fall. Pneumocephalus due to this type of injury has not been previously reported, to our knowledge. Since this unusual injury may be associated with serious complications, it must be promptly recognized and treated. "
nervous system diseases,"Kearns-Sayre syndrome presenting as renal tubular acidosis. Renal tubular acidosis and tetany were the 1st manifestations of Kearns-Sayre syndrome in a 5-year-old child. Subsequently, he developed progressive external ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, retinopathy, heart block, and endocrinopathy. There was a 7.5-kb deletion of mitochondrial DNA documented in muscle, kidney, skin fibroblasts, and leukocytes, providing evidence for a multisystem mitochondrial cytopathy. "
nervous system diseases,"Ulcerative colitis and giant cell arteritis associated with sensorineural deafness Sensorineural deafness is rarely associated with both ulcerative colitis and giant cell arteritis. A patient is described in whom acute sensorineural deafness occurred in association with episcleritis, ulcerative colitis and clinical features suggesting giant cell arteritis. "
nervous system diseases,"Spinal cord stimulation: a contemporary series Forty-three patients with chronic pain disorders of different causes were selected for spinal cord stimulation. All underwent implantation of a ribbon electrode through a small laminotomy, under general anesthesia. Thirteen patients (30%) failed to obtain significant pain relief during a period of trial stimulation, and their electrodes were removed. The remainder underwent a definitive implant and were followed for a mean of 13 months (range, 3-33 months). Nineteen of them (63%) continued to experience pain relief. A detailed analysis of this series, as well as a literature review, is presented. "
nervous system diseases,"Multiple sclerosis and narcolepsy: possible similar genetic susceptibility. We have studied 2 patients with multiple sclerosis and narcolepsy. In both patients, the DR 2 histocompatibility antigen was positive. In each of the patients, the diagnosis of narcolepsy was confirmed by polygraphic testing. "
nervous system diseases,"Recurrent transient ischemic attacks and stroke in association with an internal carotid artery web Fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic vascular disease that most commonly affects cervical carotid arteries at the C1-C2 level when cephalic arteries are involved. Several histopathologic and angiographic subtypes of fibromuscular dysplasia exist; most have a benign natural history. We describe the third reported case of a pathologically proven, symptomatic proximal internal carotid artery web and suggest that patients with this lesion are at a higher risk for stroke. "
nervous system diseases,"Sudden blindness after thermocoagulation of the trigeminal ganglion. Sudden blindness during percutaneous thermocoagulation of the gasserian ganglion occurred in a 72-year-old woman with trigeminal neuralgia. Considered a safe procedure, we highlight the possibility of this serious complication which was probably due to direct damage of the optic nerve. "
nervous system diseases,Fracture-dislocation of the base of the fifth metacarpal with an ulnar motor nerve lesion: case report. We report a case of delayed diagnosis of a fracture dislocation of the base of the fifth metacarpal with a resultant ulnar motor nerve lesion. The patient achieved marked improvement after fracture reduction and ulnar neurolysis. 
nervous system diseases,Magnetic resonance imaging of radiation optic neuropathy. Three patients with delayed radiation optic neuropathy after radiation therapy for parasellar neoplasms underwent magnetic resonance imaging. The affected optic nerves and chiasms showed enlargement and focal gadopentetate dimeglumine enhancement. The magnetic resonance imaging technique effectively detected and defined anterior visual pathway changes of radionecrosis and excluded the clinical possibility of visual loss because of tumor recurrence. 
nervous system diseases,"Giant hemangioma of the liver with pain, fever, and abnormal liver tests. Report of two cases. In conclusion, we report the cases of two patients with large hemangiomas of the liver, abdominal pain, increased ESR and fibrinogen, increased serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase activity, and normal white blood cell counts. Clinical and biochemical abnormalities disappeared after surgical resection. Increased ESR and fibrinogen are probably related to thrombosis within the tumor. This mode of presentation may suggest a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. "
nervous system diseases,"An unusual manifestation of Paget's disease of bone: spinal epidural hematoma presenting as acute cauda equina syndrome. Neurologic sequelae of Paget's disease of bone include involvement of the spinal cord or cauda equina due to mechanical compression by enlarged vertebrae, ischemia caused by a spinal artery, steal syndrome or neoplasm. We describe a patient with Paget's disease of bone who presented with acute cauda equina syndrome due to a spinal epidural hematoma. Clinicians need to recognize this entity since surgical intervention may result in a favorable outcome. "
nervous system diseases,"Clinical and electrographic effects of acute anticonvulsant withdrawal in epileptic patients. We retrospectively investigated the effects of acute antiepileptic drug (AED) withdrawal on seizure symptomatology--including frequency, clinical features, and electrical onset--by studying 35 patients during evaluation for epilepsy surgery. The highest risk for both partial and secondary generalized seizures occurred during absent or subtherapeutic, and not during rapidly falling, AED levels. AED withdrawal had minimal effect on clinical symptomatology or electrographic onset. "
nervous system diseases,"Vagal schwannoma associated with syncopal attacks and postural hypotension: a case report. A case of vagal schwannoma in the cerebellomedullary angle is reported. Preoperatively, the patient had paroxysmal episodes of postural hypotension with syncope. After total removal of the vagal tumor, her systemic blood pressure returned to normal. "
nervous system diseases,"Ocular defects in infants of extremely low birth weight and low gestational age. The eyes of 49 babies who weighed less than 1,000 g at birth or who were born at or before 28 weeks gestation were examined at the age of 4 years. Twenty-one children were normal. The remaining 29 children (59%) had ocular abnormalities which ranged from mild amblyopia to blindness from retinopathy of prematurity. The need to examine children at risk is stressed. "
nervous system diseases,"Understanding dizziness. How to decipher this nonspecific symptom. Dizziness is a common but often nonspecific symptom. Through careful history taking and physical examination, primary care physicians can usually determine the type of sensation (vertigo or light-headedness) and its source. Although most causes of dizziness are benign, disorders of the central nervous system tend to be ominous and require immediate referral to a specialist. "
nervous system diseases,"A vascular malformation mimicking an intracanalicular acoustic neurilemoma. Case report. A patient with an enhancing, completely intracanalicular mass on magnetic resonance imaging was operated on for a presumed acoustic neurilemoma, but was found at surgery to have an intracanalicular vascular malformation. This rare lesion should be distinguished from angiomatous change within an acoustic neurilemoma and in the past has been termed ""vascular tumor,"" ""hemangioma,"" or ""fibro-angioma."" The clinical distinctions between intracanalicular acoustic neurilemomas and intracanalicular vascular malformations and the ability of magnetic resonance imaging to distinguish between the two are discussed. "
nervous system diseases,"Pharmacology of recovery after stroke. Laboratory research during the past decade has begun to provide insights into the neurobiologic basis of functional recovery after brain injury. It is clear that drugs influencing specific neurotransmitters also can influence the recovery process. Some of these drugs may be beneficial, but others may be detrimental. Some of the difficulties in interpreting the results of these behavioral studies are reviewed, and potential mechanisms of drug effects are discussed. These types of studies are leading to an increased awareness of the potentially harmful effects of some drugs often given to stroke patients. Pharmacotherapy designed to enhance functional recovery after stroke may be possible in the future. "
nervous system diseases,"Naproxen sodium in menstrual migraine prophylaxis: a double-blind placebo controlled study. In this study, the efficacy of Naproxen sodium (Nxs) in the prophylaxis of Menstrual Migraine (MM) was tested, versus Placebo (PL). Forty women suffering from MM were admitted to a double-blind treatment protocol with Nxs 550 mg twice each day by mouth or Placebo (PL), for 3 months; in the next 3 months all the women were treated with the active drug in an open study. The headache intensity and duration, as well as the number of days of headache and the analgesic consumption, were significantly reduced with Nxs compared to PL. The efficacy of Nxs, shown also in improving premenstrual pain, and its good tolerability, support the use of this drug in the prophylactic therapy of MM. "
nervous system diseases,"Germ cell tumor of testis in a patient with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Germ cell testicular tumor is a previously undescribed entity in association with von Hippel-Lindau disease. This case exemplifies the variety of pathologic entities encountered in von Hippel-Lindau disease and stresses the importance of thorough evaluation of the patient, as well as careful follow-up, to ensure early detection of potentially malignant lesions. "
nervous system diseases,"Brain and spinal cord hemorrhage in long-term survivors of malignant pediatric brain tumors: a possible late effect of therapy. Three children with malignant primary CNS tumors treated with craniospinal radiotherapy developed intraparenchymal hemorrhages a median of 5 years following therapy in sites distant from the primary tumor. Radical surgical procedures disclosed fresh and old hematoma, gliosis, and necrosis in all 3 patients and an aggregation of abnormal microscopic blood vessels in two. No tumor was found. All 3 patients remain in long-term (greater than 10 years) continuous remission. "
nervous system diseases,"Aids for visual impairment. This article provides only a flavour of the type and range of aids available to the visually impaired person. Many other aids for leisure, learning, and daily living are illustrated in the RNIB equipment and games catalogue. "
nervous system diseases,"Streptococcus bovis meningitis: report of 2 cases. We describe 2 cases of Streptococcus bovis meningitis and review the 9 cases previously reported. This microorganism is a rare cause of meningitis in which there are no distinctive clinical or laboratory features. The Gram stain of the CSF is usually negative. Ten of the 11 cases had some underlying disease or comorbid condition that predisposed to S bovis infection: gastrointestinal disorder, endocarditis, CSF leak, polymyalgia rheumatica, and mandibular block. Treatment with high-dose penicillin is usually adequate. "
nervous system diseases,"Does primary fibromyalgia exist? Twenty-one of 25 consecutive primary fibromyalgia or fibrositis patients, identified during a 5-year period in a tertiary care day-ward for pain syndromes, were re-examined. Fifteen fulfilled criteria for fibromyalgia but unexpectedly, all cases had either psychiatric disturbance or thyroid dysfunction. Of the four patients not seen at follow-up, two had developed neurological diseases, another rheumatoid arthritis and one other hypothyroidism. Thus, after 5 years no patient fulfilled the criteria for primary fibromyalgia. Women occupied as manual workers were over-represented. Most patients reported beneficial effects of physiotherapy. None of the patients has been able to return to full time work. "
nervous system diseases,"Acoustic schwannoma and epidermoid cyst occurring as a single cerebellopontine angle mass. The case of a 66-year-old man with a 3-year progressive hearing loss and a homogeneous left cerebellopontine angle mass on magnetic resonance imaging scan is described. At surgery, the major portion of the mass was a typical encapsulated, solid, acoustic schwannoma, but the most rostral portion was a distinct, flaky, cystic mass without a well-defined capsule, typical of an epidermoid cyst. The radiographic and operative findings of this unique coexistence of two different benign cerebellopontine angle masses are presented. "
nervous system diseases,"Acetazolamide-responsive vestibulocerebellar syndrome: clinical and oculographic features. Five patients who presented with long-standing episodic vertigo had ocular motor signs localizing to the vestibulocerebellum. In each patient, the episodic vertigo was either abolished or markedly decreased in frequency and severity with acetazolamide therapy. In 4, other family members had identical symptoms and signs. This syndrome is 1 of the few treatable causes of chronic episodic vertigo. "
nervous system diseases,"Persistent segmental cutaneous anesthesia after a brown recluse spider bite. Patients with brown recluse spider bites commonly suffer from pain, muscular aching, and a variety of local dysesthesias during the acute and resolution phases of toxin-induced injury. This is our first well-documented observation of persistent cutaneous anesthesia caused by a spider bite. The anesthetic area conformed to the distribution of a specific nerve, the transverse cervical cutaneous nerve. The identification of the spider as a brown recluse and the location of the bite over the nerve's usual pathway strongly suggest that the venom was responsible for this complication. "
nervous system diseases,"Oestrogen and progesterone receptors in acoustic neuroma. Tissue samples from fourteen consecutive (8 male: 6 female) acoustic neuromas were assayed for hormone receptors using either a monoclonal antibody (MA), dextran coated charcoal (DCC) or isoelectric focusing (IEF) technique. In this series there were no unequivocally positive results, a finding at variance with previously published results. "
nervous system diseases,"Lymphocytic hypophysitis with involvement of the cavernous sinus and hypothalamus. Two cases of lymphocytic hypophysitis are reported, in which hypothalamic involvement causing diabetes insipidus was a prominent clinical feature. In one case, a man had clinical and radiological evidence of the involvement of the cavernous sinus. This represents the second reported case of a man with lymphocytic hypophysitis. A transsphenoidal biopsy established the diagnosis in both cases. Neither the involvement of the cavernous sinus nor permanent diabetes insipidus has been reported previously. A review of the literature is provided. "
nervous system diseases,"Fulminant hepatitis after lisinopril administration. A case of fulminant hepatitis in a patient taking lisinopril for 5 weeks for arterial hypertension is reported. Jaundice, fever, myalgia, and marked increase in serum aminotransferase activities occurred after 2 weeks of treatment. Continuation of lisinopril administration for 3 weeks after the onset of jaundice was associated with the development of grade III encephalopathy and a marked decrease in prothrombin and proaccelerin levels. This case strongly suggests that lisinopril may induce acute hepatitis and that continuation of the treatment after the onset of jaundice can lead to life-threatening hepatic failure. "
nervous system diseases,"Cerebrospinal fluid eicosanoid levels: endogenous PGD2 and LTC4 synthesis by antigen-presenting cells that migrate to the central nervous system. We analyzed CSF from patients with multiple sclerosis, patients with other neurologic diseases, and healthy controls for the presence of prostaglandin (PG) E2, F2 alpha, D2, I, A, and leukotriene (LT) C4. Control CSF had little measurable PGs or LTs. CSF eicosanoids from patients with progressive MS were increased. We found PGD2 only in MS CSF. CSF monocytes from patients in active disease produced significantly increased PGD, PGE, and LTC4 than paired peripheral blood monocytes and monocytes from healthy controls. We saw no significant difference in LTC4 production between MS and control peripheral blood monocytes. "
nervous system diseases,Gadolinium-MRI in acute transverse myelopathy. A patient with acute transverse myelopathy (ATM) had serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies before and after administration of gadolinium (Gd-DTPA). Gd-DTPA-MRI was useful in estimating the pathologic extent and residual deficit expected in ATM. 
nervous system diseases,"Apparent reduction in the size of one side of the face associated with a small retrosplenial haemorrhage. A 68 year old Japanese female with unilateral metamorphopsia of the face that developed after a small haemorrhage in the contralateral retrosplenial region, is described. The patient claimed that the right side of a face, that is, the left side when looked at by the patient, appeared smaller than the left. In addition, her drawings of the face showed some distortions. Objects other than the face were perceived normally. Cranial CT scan revealed a small high density area in the right retrosplenial region. The face appears to have a special representation in the posterior hemisphere. "
nervous system diseases,Intrathecal anaesthesia for day-care surgery. A retrospective study of 160 cases using 25- and 26-gauge spinal needles. The records of 160 day-care surgical patients who received intrathecal anaesthesia were reviewed. No major complications were recorded. The incidence of postspinal headache after puncture with a 25-gauge spinal needle was nearly four times more frequent compared to a 26-gauge needle. The occurrence of postspinal headache in patients over the age of 45 years was significantly less frequent (p less than 0.05) than in younger patients. Intrathecal anaesthesia was acceptable to 91% of outpatients in this group. 
nervous system diseases,"Primary intracerebral sarcoma in childhood: case report with electron-microscope study. A case of a primary intracerebral sarcoma is described in a 5-year-old girl. Histology and immunohistochemistry excluded the diagnosis of a leiomyosarcoma, a malignant haemangiopericytoma or a fibrosarcoma; electron-microscopical findings indicated that the origin of the sarcoma was in the pia mater. "
nervous system diseases,"Pregnancy in a patient with treated Wilson's disease: a case report. Pregnancy should have a successful outcome in a patient with treated Wilson's disease if complications are excluded before conception. Chelating treatment must be maintained, although there is some concern about its teratogenicity. We describe the course of pregnancy in a patient followed up in our department. "
nervous system diseases,"Temporal bone findings in two cases of head injury. Temporal bone findings in two cases of head injury are reported. In one patient, longitudinal fractures occurred in both temporal bones, and extended to the middle ear bilaterally. Bleeding was seen in the tympanic cavity, mastoid air cells, internal auditory meatus and facial nerve canal. Bleeding was observed in the scala tympani, cochlear aqueduct and endolymphatic sac, but there were no fractures. In the other patient, bleeding was seen in the internal auditory meatus and facial nerve canal. In the right ear, endolymphatic hydrops was observed in all turns of the cochlea. "
nervous system diseases,"Cognitive strategies during coincident timing tasks. Research findings suggest that experience and cognitive strategies contribute to successful performance during perceptual-motor tasks. This article critically reviews selected literature on the effects of information-processing skills, preferred movement time, experience, and task difficulty on performance during coincident timing tasks. Theoretical information and research findings are discussed, and their applications to clinical practice are considered. Clinical recommendations include assessment of coincident timing skills and use of functional activities that provide opportunities to explore and dynamically interact with the environment. "
nervous system diseases,"Whither short-course chemotherapy for tuberculous meningitis? Short-course chemotherapy is well established for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis but not for extrapulmonary disease. We present a series of 35 cases in which chemotherapy for tuberculous meningitis was given for a period of less than 2 years. Short-term therapy was associated with recrudescence of tuberculous meningitis and, in some cases, with the development of deep cerebral infarcts and permanent neurological deficits. We think short-term chemotherapy for tuberculosis of the central nervous system is inadequate. "
nervous system diseases,"Events associated with rupture of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation devices. Nineteen intra-aortic balloon (IAB) ruptures occurred in sixteen patients during a three-year period. Perforation occurred secondary to abrasion with material failure or mishandling of the device during insertion. To avoid serious sequelae, it is important to be aware of the possibility of IAB rupture and to remove any defective device immediately upon recognition of an event. "
nervous system diseases,"Corneal sensitivity and correlations between decreased sensitivity and anterior segment pathology in ocular leprosy. Leprosy is one of the leading causes of corneal hyposensitivity. In this article the corneal sensitivity of 143 leprosy patients was examined, and correlations between corneal hyposensitivity and anterior segment pathology were detected. Twenty four healthy volunteers were examined as controls. Various degrees of corneal loss of sensitivity were found in 46.2% of leprosy patients. Lagophthalmos, chronic lepromatous granulomatous uveitis, iris atrophy, and social blindness were found 4.5-16.6 times more frequently in eyes which developed severe corneal hyposensitivity. "
nervous system diseases,"Sexual behavior of a sample of females with epilepsy. A sample of 700 female epileptic outpatients was examined between 1985 and 1987. The incidence of psychosexual disorders was 18%. Epileptic females with psychosexual disorders were compared with epileptic females without sexual disorders and with normal female controls on selected clinical and EEG parameters. Epileptic females with sexual disorders showed: lower marriage rates, a longer duration of illness, sexually colored prodromata, predominance of partial complex seizures (83%) and a higher incidence of menstrual abnormalities. Hyposexuality and exhibitionism were the psychosexual disorders most frequently noted. Temporal lobe EEG abnormalities were significantly higher. "
nervous system diseases,Cavernous-carotid thrombosis and ocular motor paresis A 64-year-old man presented with the acute onset of unilateral blindness and ipsilateral ocular motor paresis. Occlusion of the central retinal artery associated with thrombosis of the internal carotid artery in the cavernous sinus was demonstrated by angiography and magnetic resonance imaging. Cases of carotid thrombosis associated with ipsilateral ocular motor paresis are rare. The pathophysiology of intracavernous carotid thrombosis is discussed in connection with blood supply of the cranial nerves in the cavernous sinus. 
nervous system diseases,"Burden: a review of measures used among caregivers of individuals with dementia This paper critiques and discusses 10 measures of burden that have been used with caregivers of individuals with dementia. Current measures target diverse caregiver and care recipient populations, and vary in conceptualization and measurement of burden. Although many measures contain reliability data, relatively few report content validity, convergent/divergent validity, criterion validity, or sensitivity to change. Implications of these limitations for research and clinical practice are discussed. "
nervous system diseases,"Handcuff neuropathies Compressive neuropathy due to tight application of handcuffs occurred in 5 patients. The superficial radial nerve was affected in 8 hands and the median nerve in two. Neurologic deficits persisted as long as 3 years after handcuffing. Nerve conduction studies helped to exclude malingering and other diagnoses. All patients had been intoxicated when handcuffed or had been arrested with force. The handcuff mechanism, which allows accidental overtightening after application, is an unrecognized factor in these neuropathies. "
nervous system diseases,"Long-term efficacy of primary laser trabeculoplasty. Sixty glaucomatous eyes of 60 patients treated with laser trabeculoplasty as primary therapy were reviewed retrospectively. There were 42 eyes with capsular glaucoma and 18 with simple glaucoma. The mean prelaser intraocular pressure (IOP) was 35.2 (SD = 6.5) mmHg. Success was defined as IOP less than or equal to 22 mmHg without medication. The probability of success was 0.73 at 1 year, 0.66 at 2 years, 0.57 at 3 years, and 0.50 at 4 years. Three eyes experienced progressive visual field loss or disc damage in spite of an intraocular pressure below 22 mmHg without medication. High prelaser pressure and the severity of the visual field defects were significant predictors of treatment failure. "
nervous system diseases,"32-gauge spinal catheters through 26-gauge needles Small diameter intrathecal catheters potentially combine the certainty of intrathecal injection and the advantage of repeatability, without the risk of a high incidence of headache after dural puncture. We report problems placing such catheters. "
nervous system diseases,"Neurologic complications of the tryptophan-associated eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. A case of tryptophan-associated eosinophilia, central nervous system complications, and multiple white matter lesions by magnetic resonance imaging is presented. Eosinophilia regardless of its cause should be included within the differential of patients exhibiting periventricular white matter lesions. "
nervous system diseases,"Effects of head trauma from motor vehicle accidents on Parkinson's disease. During 1 year we monitored changes in clinical disability scores in 10 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who sustained head trauma from motor vehicle accidents. Disability significantly increased immediately after trauma, but returned to baseline levels in subsequent weeks. These patients' signs deteriorated over the subsequent year, but this decline was equivalent to that of a matched control group with PD who did not have a motor vehicle accident or trauma. Based on these data, we conclude that trauma or stress caused by motor vehicle accidents can transiently exacerbate parkinsonian dysfunction without causing persistent increased disability or an alteration in disease course. "
nervous system diseases,"Fine surface structure of an intraspinal neurenteric cyst: a scanning and transmission electron microscopy study. The case of an 11-year-old boy with an intraspinal neurenteric cyst, which recurred 8 years and 3 months after surgery, is presented. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy of the cyst epithelium revealed marked resemblance to that of the respiratory tract, despite the presence of numerous goblet cells mimicking intestine on light microscopy study. Detailed ultrastructural findings are described. "
nervous system diseases,"Temporal bone: three-dimensional CT. Part II. Pathologic alterations. Three-dimensional (3D) surface renderings were obtained from routine axial computed tomographic (CT) images in 15 patients with a variety of complex temporal bone abnormalities. The 3D CT reformations served as an adjunct to conventional sectional CT examination. While no diagnosis was substantially changed because of the 3D CT images, they did provide a more global perspective in cases of large tumors and fractures and at the postmastoidectomy site. Three-dimensional CT surface reformations are now practical and may be potentially useful for visualizing temporal bone lesions characterized by complex destructive change. "
nervous system diseases,"Distribution of three alpha-chain beta-hexosaminidase A mutations among Tay-Sachs carriers. DNA from 176 carriers of the Tay-Sachs gene was tested for the presence of the three mutations most commonly found among Ashkenazi Jews: the so-called insertion, splice junction, and adult mutations. Among 148 Ashkenazi Jews tested, 108 had the insertion mutation, 26 had the splice junction mutation, five had the adult mutation, and nine had none of the three. Among 28 non-Jewish carriers tested, most of whom were obligate carriers, four had the insertion mutation, one had the adult mutation, and the remaining 23 had none of the three. "
nervous system diseases,"Dreams and epilepsy. The relationship between dreams and epilepsy is illustrated by two patients whose awake epileptic seizures and recurrent dreams during night sleep had similar content. In both of our cases the EEG showed right anterior temporal spike discharge, suggesting a role for the temporal lobe in the association between dreams and seizures. "
nervous system diseases,"Alzheimer's disease and related disorders in state mental hospitals: data from a nationwide survey. Notwithstanding three decades of transferring of the elderly to nursing homes, geriatric patients continue to reside in state mental hospitals. Many of these patients, perhaps one-third or more, are thought to suffer from Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD). This study reports data from a nationwide survey of state hospitals that provides an exploratory look at the ADRD patients currently served in state hospitals. Admission trends, reasons for admission, and sources of referral are described. Civil commitment of nursing home patients with dementing illnesses and the place of the state hospital in the continuum of care for ADRD patients are discussed. "
nervous system diseases,"Unusually late onset of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea after head trauma. Two cases of acute meningitis and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, in which the head trauma responsible occurred 10 and 30 years before, are presented. Intraoperatively, the brain parenchyma was found to be plugged into the fractured anterior fossa. By debridement and duraplasty from an intradural approach, both patients were cured. Several precipitating factors could be responsible for this unusually late reopening of the fistula. The possible accidental causes could be coughing or undetected microtraumas, but in the long run, atrophy of tissues and consequent changes in brain compliance with aging may play a role. "
nervous system diseases,Use of EMLA cream as an analgesic in the management of painful otitis externa. A new application of EMLA cream is described. Relief of pain in otitis externa is difficult and systemic analgesics for this localized condition are often ineffective. Meticulous cleaning of the external auditory meatus is an essential step in the treatment. EMLA cream is an effective analgesic which can be used to relieve pain and anaesthetize the external auditory meatus to allow cleaning in patients with intact tympanic membranes. 
nervous system diseases,Treatment of chronic relapsing inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy by cyclosporin A and plasma exchange. A case report. A patient with chronic relapsing inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy was successfully treated with plasma exchanges and cyclosporin A (CsA). Dynamometric measurements of hand force during the time of CsA treatment showed a highly significant correlation between hand force and CsA blood levels. The largest influence of CsA on hand force occurred 11-13 days after CsA uptake. 
nervous system diseases,Suppression of carbamazepine-induced rash with prednisone. We report our experience with 20 patients who developed a rash shortly after the introduction of carbamazepine and were treated with prednisone and an antihistamine. Sixteen patients were successfully continued on carbamazepine while 4 had to discontinue the drug. 
nervous system diseases,"Orocaecal transit time in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Smooth muscle degeneration may occur in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We measured fasting orocaecal transit time in patients with advanced Duchenne muscular dystrophy and other muscular dystrophies and in healthy controls. No significant differences were found. In contrast to reports of gastric hypomotility in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, we found no evidence of impaired small intestinal motility. "
nervous system diseases,"Response to suxamethonium in a myasthenic patient during remission. A cumulative dose followed by an infusion was used to determine the dose response to suxamethonium in a patient with diagnosed myasthenia gravis who was in true remission (asymptomatic while receiving no therapy). The ED50 and ED90 values for suxamethonium were 0.08 mg/kg and 0.20 mg/kg, and an infusion rate of 3.2 mg/kg/hour was required to maintain a 90-95% depression of the single twitch response as monitored by integrated electromyography. These values are within the range for normal patients, and we conclude that myasthenic patients during a true remission may not demonstrate resistance to suxamethonium. "
nervous system diseases,Accidental death from a black-powder rifle breech plug. Authentic black-powder muzzle-loader weapons and replicas are used today primarily for hunting game such as deer and hogs. The following is a case presentation of accidental death from cerebral trauma caused by a .45-caliber black-powder-rifle breech plug implanting in the victim's brain. 
nervous system diseases,"Stereotactic investigation of limbic epilepsy using a multimodal image analysis system. Technical note. A methodology has been developed for stereotactic investigation of limbic epilepsy using an image-analysis system that simultaneously displays different structural and functional images of the brain. The validity and accuracy of this system were established with phantom studies. Surgical planning and electrode implantation are guided by stereotactic magnetic resonance imaging, digital subtraction angiography, and position emission tomography. This methodology provides the spatiotemporal relationship of cerebral structure and function necessary to identify seizure onset and propagation in human limbic system epilepsy. "
nervous system diseases,"Seizure-associated speech arrest in elderly patients Recurrent, brief episodes of speech arrest associated with bifrontal electroencephalographic seizure activity developed in three ill elderly patients. The seizures ceased after the initiation of antiepileptic drug therapy and the correction of metabolic abnormalities. The cause of the seizure activity remains unknown, but a possible mechanism may be a transient epileptogenic cortical dysfunction that predominantly affects the frontal lobes as a result of concomitant metabolic alterations. "
nervous system diseases,Subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a fungal aneurysm of the vertebral artery as a complication of intracranial aneurysm clipping. Case report. Intracranial aneurysms are an uncommon manifestation of fungal infection. A case is described in which the formation of an aneurysm followed an intracranial intraoperative Aspergillus infection attributable to a long period of preoperative antibiotic medication and immunosuppressive therapy with steroids. 
nervous system diseases,"Traumatic asphyxia. Traumatic asphyxia is a distinctive clinical syndrome characterized by cervicofacial cyanosis and edema, multiple petechiae, and subconjunctival hemorrhage after a severe crush injury of the thorax or of the upper part of the abdomen. A case of traumatic asphyxia is reported, and its clinical and pathophysiologic features are discussed. "
nervous system diseases,"Spirochetal infection of the central nervous system. Four spirochetal diseases frequently involve the central nervous system: syphilis, leptospirosis, relapsing fever, and Lyme borreliosis. In particular, syphilis and Lyme borreliosis are increasing problems. During the spirochetemic phase there is seeding of the nervous system. After a quiescent latent period, there may be late disease flareups producing a variety of neurologic syndromes. Cerebrospinal fluid examination is very helpful in these infections. "
nervous system diseases,A comparison of midazolam with and without nalbuphine for intravenous sedation. The introduction of nalbuphine to intravenous sedation with midazolam added little to the quality of sedation for short operative procedures. There was a greater tendency for patients who received nalbuphine and midazolam to sleep in the afternoon after treatment compared with those who received only midazolam. Significantly more patients had nausea and vomiting in the midazolam/nalbuphine group than did patients in the midazolam-only group. 
nervous system diseases,Propofol infusion for control of status epilepticus. Two patients with status epilepticus who were resistant to conventional treatment but responded to propofol infusions are reported. An electroencephalogram confirmed the seizures and their successful treatment. 
nervous system diseases,"Parapharyngeal abscess and torticollis. The combination of a parapharyngeal abscess and torticollis in an adult, due to a spastic contraction of the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle is an extremely rare condition. We have recently been exposed to such case, in which it was very difficult to make the diagnosis and where CT of the neck gave us the answers without any difficulty. The indication for CT at an early stage in unexplained neck infections is stressed. "
nervous system diseases,7th nerve palsy after extradural blood patch. We describe a patient who developed a 7th cranial nerve palsy following an extradural blood patch; full recovery followed. The likely aetiology is discussed. 
nervous system diseases,Gaze-evoked visual seizures in nonketotic hyperglycemia. Focal motor seizures are commonly a symptom of nonketotic hyperglycemia (NKH). Posture-induced motor seizures are less common but have been reported in some patients with this disorder. We report the first case of gaze-evoked sensory (visual) seizures in nonketotic hyperglycemia. Both seizures and ictal EEG findings disappeared shortly after hyperglycemia was corrected. 
nervous system diseases,"Percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty in sickle cell anemia: a case report. Percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty was performed on a 19-year-old female who had moderate pulmonary valve stenosis with sickle cell anemia. The patient developed sickle cell crisis resulting in occipital infarction, but she made a good recovery. We describe this case and the methods of reducing the risk of sickle cell crisis. "
nervous system diseases,"Extrageniculate vision in hemianopic humans: saccade inhibition by signals in the blind field. The functional competence of extrageniculate visual pathways in hemianopic humans was demonstrated by showing that distractor signals in the blind half of the visual field could inhibit saccades toward targets in the intact visual field. This inhibitory effect of unseen distractors in patients occurred only when distractors were presented in the temporal half of the visual field, was specific to oculomotor responses, and did not occur in normal subjects. These results show that a peripheral visual signal activates retinotectal pathways to prime the oculomotor system and that these pathways can mediate orienting behavior in hemianopic humans. "
nervous system diseases,"Scaphoid malunion. We reviewed 10 patients with symptomatic malunion of a carpal scaphoid fracture. All had displacement with dorsiflexed intercalated segment instability, and suffered from pain, restricted range of movement at the wrist and decreased grip strength. The restriction of flexion-extension and the decreased grip strength correlated with the severity of the DISI deformity. Seven patients had a corrective osteotomy, using an anterior wedge-shape bone graft with internal fixation by Herbert screw, and all had satisfactory results. We believe that symptoms associated with scaphoid malunion are related to consequent carpal deformity. "
nervous system diseases,"Sensorineural hearing loss: a reversible effect of valproic acid. We report 2 patients over the age of 70 who, while on valproate (VPA) for complex partial seizures, developed sensorineural hearing loss. Following discontinuation of VPA for nonaudiologic reasons, the patients reported improved hearing which was confirmed by audiometry. These findings represent VPA-induced sensorineural hearing loss, possibly in preexisting presbycusis. "
nervous system diseases,"Nontropical pyomyositis as a cause of subacute, multifocal myalgia in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. We report a case of nontropical pyomyositis in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disseminated Mycobacterium avium infection, in which severe myalgia was the presenting symptom over several weeks. Multifocal muscle lesions were identified by gallium scanning and magnetic resonance imaging techniques. The epidemiology, possible pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnostic imaging, and therapy are reviewed. Early suspicion of nontropical pyomyositis in severely immunocompromised patients with ""cryptic"" myalgia is recommended. "
nervous system diseases,"Surgical treatment of a rare congenital anomaly of the vertebral artery: case report and review of the literature. A case of an abnormal loop of the vertebral artery compressing both the cervicomedullary junction and the accessory nerve is reported. The embryological development of the vertebrobasilar system may explain this anatomical anomaly. The possibility of an abnormal location of the vertebral artery may complicate the lateral C1-C2 puncture for myelography. Only five similar cases have been reported previously, but none of them presented any clinical symptomatology, and surgical treatment was never required. The present patient was cured by microvascular decompression. The pathogenetic and surgical implications are discussed in light of the literature. "
nervous system diseases,"Magnetic resonance imaging of fourth ventricular epidermoid tumors. Two pathologically proved cases of epidermoid tumor of the fourth ventricle are presented; clinical history and computed tomographic, magnetic resonance imaging, and histopathologic findings are included. "
nervous system diseases,"Misperceptions of comprehension difficulties of stroke patients by doctors, nurses and relatives. Doctors, nurses and relatives involved with 30 recently aphasic stroke patients were asked to predict how the patient would perform on a comprehension test. Results show that not only do doctors, nurses and relatives underestimate the receptive disability of these patients, but they also illustrate a lack of agreement between health professionals. Implications for management are considered. "
nervous system diseases,Methsuximide for intractable childhood seizures. Methsuximide was added to the therapeutic regimens of 25 children with intractable epilepsy. In 15 patients the drug was well tolerated and resulted in a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. No serious or irreversible adverse effects were seen. Methsuximide is frequently overlooked and may be an effective adjunctive antiepileptic for children with intractable seizures. 
nervous system diseases,"Optic nerve gliomas and meningiomas. Optic nerve gliomas are benign astrocytic neoplasms that primarily affect children. The ultimate prognosis for vision is poor. For lesions confined to the optic nerves, long-term survival is excellent, but with involvement of the chiasm and especially of the hypothalamus or third ventricle, prognosis falls significantly. For this group, no form of therapy has proven to be of any benefit. Optic sheath meningiomas are neoplasms arising from arachnoid cap cells. They primarily affect middle-aged adults. Like gliomas, the prognosis for vision is poor, but unlike gliomas, prognosis for life is excellent. "
nervous system diseases,"Headache and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Because the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) virus is neurotropic, physicians will continue to see a rise in the number of neurologic complications of this syndrome. Much of this increase will be accompanied by headache, not only as a primary symptom of HIV infection or opportunistic disease but also as a result of diagnostic tests and therapeutic efforts. Complete understanding of the ramifications of headache in AIDS will be important in the 1990s as we continue to treat a younger population, usually affected by benign vascular and muscle contraction-type headache. "
nervous system diseases,"Kenneth McKenzie, Harvey Cushing, and the early neurosurgical treatment of spasmodic torticollis. In 1923, Dr. Kenneth McKenzie trained at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital under Dr. Harvey Cushing. At that time, a patient with spasmodic torticollis came to Cushing and was treated with an innovative operation for this disorder with good results. This case sparked an interest in Dr. McKenzie, who published the case 1 year later. In reviewing the surgical histories from the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, we have found the original records of this well-documented case. The record includes postoperative drawings of the intraoperative field by Dr. Cushing, a sketch by Dr. McKenzie illustrating the postoperative sensory examination, and pre- and postoperative photographs of the patient. "
nervous system diseases,"Humor, aggression, and aging. Humor response to aggressive cartoons was investigated by using ratings of pain and funniness of cartoons by 154 young and elderly men and women. No significant age differences were found; however, sex differences were found. For both young and elderly females, an inverted-U described the relationship between pain and funniness ratings. For young and elderly males, there was no relationship between pain and funniness. This is a preliminary step in exploring age differences in humor but may be relevant for those working with elderly persons. "
nervous system diseases,"Aspiration in bilateral stroke patients. Seventy patients with bilateral strokes underwent neurologic and videofluoroscopic barium swallowing examinations; 34 (48.6%) aspirated. Patients with aspiration were more likely to have posterior circulation strokes, abnormal cough, abnormal gag, and dysphonia. However, patients likely to aspirate can be identified best by the presence of an abnormal voluntary cough, an abnormal gag reflex, or both. The prediction of patients at risk for aspiration was not improved by additional clinical information (ie, presence of dysphonia or bilateral neurologic signs). "
nervous system diseases,Bacterial meningitis in adults. Bacterial meningitis continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality despite the availability of effective bactericidal antibiotics. Penicillin or ampicillin remains the drug of choice for meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. The third generation cephalosporins have revolutionized the treatment of gram-negative meningitis. Future therapy for bacterial meningitis will use recent developments in the understanding of pathogenic and pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this disease. 
nervous system diseases,"Primary leptomeningeal B-cell lymphoma in a 8-year-old child. A case of primary leptomeningeal B-cell lymphoma in an 8-year-old, previously healthy child is described. The child was found to have hypogammaglobulinemia, and the Epstein-Barr virus genome was identified in cultured tumor cells despite blood serology being negative for the virus. The patient was treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and dexamethasone, plus intrathecal methotrexate, and initially improved. Before the initiation of craniospinal radiation, the patient developed progressive disease, deteriorated, and died 9 months after the onset of symptoms. "
nervous system diseases,"Cauda equina syndrome associated with multiple lumbar arachnoid cysts in ankylosing spondylitis: improvement following surgical therapy. A case of cauda equina syndrome with multiple lumbar arachnoid cysts complicating ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is described. The value of computerised tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a non-invasive means of establishing the diagnosis is emphasised. In contrast to previously reported cases the patient showed neurological improvement following surgical therapy. Surgery may be indicated in some patients, particularly when there is nerve root compression by the arachnoid cysts and when the patient is seen early before irreversible damage to the cauda equina has occurred. "
nervous system diseases,"Persistent neutrophilic meningitis. Persistent neutrophilic meningitis is an unusual but distinct clinical variant of chronic meningitis characterized by CSF neutrophilia with hypoglycorrhachia which persists for more than 1 week on serial CSF studies. Documented etiologies include selected bacteria and higher bacteria such as Brucella, Nocardia and Actinomyces as well as ""opportunistic"" fungi such as Candida, Aspergillus, the Zygomycetes, and Pseudallescheria. Recognition of the syndrome is important, as empiric therapy (e.g., cotrimoxazole and amphotericin B) may differ significantly from that used for classic chronic meningitis. "
nervous system diseases,"Headaches in dementia. We investigated 288 elderly subjects with various degree of dementia, focusing on headaches. Seventy-three of 288 elderly subjects (25.3%) complained of some headaches. The most common type was the tension-type headache, from which 43 of the 73 subjects with headaches (58.9%) suffered. The degree of cognitive disturbances, evaluated by Hasegawa's intelligence scale, significantly correlated to the prevalence of headaches, and indicated that patients with dementia appeared to have less headaches. The methodological issues and views on headache research in dementia were assessed, and it is concluded that the field is a difficult one, with potential for error. "
nervous system diseases,"Saphenous nerve entrapment caused by pes anserine bursitis mimicking stress fracture of the tibia. Numerous studies have addressed saphenous nerve entrapment at the level of the adductor canal. In this case, we report an entrapment syndrome located further distally occurring as part of an athletic overuse injury. Distal tibial pain, initially managed as a stress fracture, resolved when a pes anserine bursitis was treated. This was associated with return of saphenous nerve potentials along the tibia. "
nervous system diseases,Fungal pseudomeningitis superimposed on Escherichia coli meningitis. Pseudomeningitis is the demonstration of microorganisms from the cerebrospinal fluid by stain or culture in a patient with symptoms suggesting meningitis. This is a report of fungal pseudomeningitis superimposed on a case of nosocomial Escherichia coli meningitis resulting from a neurosurgical procedure. Critical care personnel need to be aware of the possibility of pseudomeningitis with or without associated meningitis in the appropriate setting. 
nervous system diseases,"Methamphetamine. Stimulant of the 1990s? During the past several years, the use of a smokable form of methamphetamine hydrochloride called ""ice"" has increased rapidly. The heaviest use has occurred on the West Coast and in Hawaii. Many regional emergency departments treat more methamphetamine users than cocaine-intoxicated patients. The ease of synthesis from inexpensive and readily available chemicals makes possible the rampant abuse of a dangerous drug that can produce a euphoria similar to that induced by cocaine. Clinicians should be familiar with the medical effects and treatment of acute methamphetamine toxicity. "
nervous system diseases,The appearance of the piriformis muscle syndrome in computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. A case report and review of the literature. The piriformis syndrome (PS) is a controversial cause of hip pain because of the lack of objective findings to support the diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed PS in a 27-year-old woman. This case may be one of the first reports in the literature on a piriformis muscle enlargement documented by CT and MR imaging. 
nervous system diseases,"Richner-Hanhart's syndrome. Electron microscopic study of the skin lesion. The plantar hyperkeratotic skin lesion in a case of Richner-Hanhart's syndrome was investigated using ultrastructural examination. Light microscopic examination showed remarkable hyperkeratosis and some aberrant keratinocytes with multiple nuclei. On ultrastructural examination, some abnormal structures were seen in the affected keratinocytes: aggregations of tonofilaments and intracytoplasmic inclusions. The inclusions were needle shaped and were considered to be ""crystal ghosts,"" presumably of tyrosine. The formation of tyrosine crystalline inclusions seems to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of the cutaneous lesions in Richner-Hanhart's syndrome. "
nervous system diseases,"Clinical diagnostic considerations on cocaine abuse. Following a review of the research literature on the psychophysiological effects of cocaine, a study is described of a group of 120 cocaine addicts. Of the 120 patients, 10 (8.33%) exhibited fleeting, unformed, organic delusions and hallucinations. Case reports of the 10 cases are presented. The quality of the adverse subjective effects of cocaine is emphasized, and the differential diagnosis between Cocaine Delusional Disorder and Paranoid Schizophrenia is discussed. Guidelines for a more accurate differential diagnosis are provided. "
nervous system diseases,"Trichothiodystrophy with chronic neutropenia and mild mental retardation. Trichothiodystrophy is a feature of several diseases that consist of characteristic hair shaft abnormalities and a wide spectrum of other developmental defects. Detection of sulfur-deficient hairs identifies this disorder and separates it from other similar ectodermal dysplasias with normal sulfur content. Detection of low sulfur hair syndrome is also important for genetic counseling, because the disease appears to be an autosomal recessive trait. We report a patient with chronic neutropenia, mild mental retardation, and low sulfur content in hair. Our case expands the spectrum of disorders associated with trichothiodystrophy. "
nervous system diseases,"Meralgia paresthetica after coronary bypass surgery. Meralgia paresthetica is a neurologic disorder characterized by localized paresthesia and numbness on the anterolateral aspect of the thigh and involving the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. It involves no motor deficits. Meralgia paresthetica, which may result from a variety of causes, has been observed as a rare complication in heart operations. Its cause when associated with such operations is uncertain but may be prolonged relaxed positioning on the operating table and recovery room stretcher. Another possible cause of meralgia paresthetica after heart operations is the ""frog-leg"" position of the legs during vein harvesting. Patients with this condition should be advised of its untreatable, but benign and self-limiting, nature. "
nervous system diseases,"Urinary retention due to sacral myeloradiculitis: a clinical and neurophysiological study. We report 5 cases of sacral myeloradiculitis presenting with transient urinary retention. Neurophysiological testing, including bulbocavernosus reflex, pudendal evoked response and external anal sphincter electromyography, was performed. Parasympathetic pelvic nerves, pudendal nerves as well as the spinal cord seem to be involved to various degrees in this infrequent disorder. "
nervous system diseases,"Tongue atrophy in mixed connective tissue disease. A case is reported of tongue atrophy in a patient with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) and major myositic involvement. The case highlights oropharyngeal aspects of MCTD, including inability to wear dentures, dysarthria, and dysphagia. To our knowledge this is the first report of major tongue involvement in myositis as part of MCTD. "
nervous system diseases,"Relief of injection pain in adults. EMLA cream for 5 minutes before venepuncture. The effectiveness of skin anaesthesia after 5 minutes' topical application of a lignocaine-prilocaine cream was evaluated. One hundred and twenty patients estimated the pain of antecubital venepuncture both on a linear scale and verbally after use of the cream for either 5 or 60 minutes, a placebo cream or no treatment. Reported pain was significantly less after only 5 minutes of the lignocaine-prilocaine cream (p = 0.002). The cream can be used to relieve the pain of all routine injections. "
nervous system diseases,"Low plasma iron status and akathisia. Thirty patients were examined to test the hypothesis that a depletion of iron levels is associated with symptoms of akathisia. Fifteen akathisic patients were pair-matched with 15 non-akathisic patients. Plasma ferritin levels were significantly decreased in the akathisic patients, and there was a significant inverse correlation between plasma iron levels and akathisia rating. In addition, akathisia ratings were found to be correlated with a scale measuring symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. "
nervous system diseases,"Atlanto-occipital disarticulation. Accident characteristics. A retrospective study of cases of atlanto-occipital disarticulation was conducted to describe incident characteristics: 24 cases were identified, including nine motor vehicle drivers, two passengers, seven pedestrians, and five motorcyclists; one other person had fallen four stories. The highest rates were found among motorcyclists and pedestrians. Atlanto-occipital disarticulations occur in high-energy impacts and collisions and are associated with aortic laceration in 25% and basilar skull fracture in 21% of such cases. Current restraint systems and motorcycle helmets do not appear to prevent this generally rapidly fatal injury. "
nervous system diseases,"Intrapartum, intranasal cocaine use and acute fetal distress. A case report. Intrapartum, intranasal cocaine was used for relief of labor pains by a healthy woman with an uncomplicated pregnancy. Fetal hypoxemia and distress followed the event. A causal relationship between the intrapartum use of cocaine and the fetal distress was postulated. Cocaine abusers could benefit from hospitalization early in labor for close surveillance and monitoring, thus avoiding exposure to cocaine and its unpredictable systemic effects. "
nervous system diseases,"Risk factors for white matter changes detected by magnetic resonance imaging in the elderly. We found increased age (p = 0.001) and history or evidence of stroke (p = 0.016) to be significant independent multivariate predictors of the presence and severity of leukoencephalopathy on magnetic resonance imaging brain scans in a mixed population of 35 elderly psychiatric patients and 25 neurologically healthy elderly volunteers. These results suggest that subcortical ischemia, as well as age-related changes that may not be vascular in origin, contribute to the emergence of periventricular and other deep white matter hyperintensities that are commonly seen on the magnetic resonance imaging brain scans of older adults. "
nervous system diseases,"Aberrant regeneration in a case of syringobulbia: selective co-activation of abducens and facial nerves during saccades. A patient suffering from syringobulbia and syringomyelia exhibited a phasic contraction of the ipsilateral facial muscles, mainly the levator labii, whenever he looked to the left or right. Facial muscle twitches occurred exclusively with saccades. The selective co-activation of abducens and facial nerves is interpreted as the result of bilateral misrouting of regenerating neurons from the parapontine reticular formation to the facial nerve in the tegmentum pontis. "
nervous system diseases,"Spinal catheter anaesthesia for caesarean section in a patient with spina bifida. A patient with grossly deformed vertebral anatomy, scheduled for elective Caesarean section, expressed her wish to stay fully awake during the procedure. Epidural anaesthesia was considered to be impracticable, while dural puncture appeared possible only at thoracic level. Spinal anaesthesia using a subarachnoid catheter placed at T7-8 was employed successfully. "
nervous system diseases,"High signal intensity in MR images of calcified brain tissue. Calcified lesions of the brain occasionally appear bright on T1-weighted MR images. This report shows that particulate calcium can reduce T1 relaxation times by a surface relaxation mechanism. Calcium particles with greater surface area show greater T1 relaxivity. Reduced proton density and reduced T2 tend to diminish signal intensity, but reduced T1 increases signal intensity. Thus, for concentrations of calcium particulate of up to 30% by weight, the signal intensity on standard T1-weighted images increases but subsequently decreases. "
nervous system diseases,"The painful shoulder: Part I. Extrinsic disorders. Shoulder disorders are most commonly manifested by pain and limited function. Careful history and examination help the physician localize the problem to the shoulder joint, the surrounding tissues or adjacent sites that can cause referred pain to the shoulder. Common extrinsic causes of shoulder pain include postural problems and cervical spine disorders. "
nervous system diseases,"Pre-trigeminal neuralgia. Eighteen patients who subsequently developed typical trigeminal neuralgia experienced a prodromal pain termed ""pre-trigeminal neuralgia."" These patients described their prodromal pain as a toothache or sinusitis-like pain lasting up to several hours, sometimes triggered by jaw movements or by drinking hot or cold liquids. Typical trigeminal neuralgia developed a few days to 12 years later, and in all cases affected the same division of the trigeminal nerve. Six additional patients experiencing what appeared to be pre-trigeminal neuralgia became pain-free when taking carbamazepine or baclofen. Recognition of pretrigeminal neuralgia makes it possible to relieve the pain with appropriate medications and avoid unnecessary irreversible dental procedures. "
nervous system diseases,Prenatal diagnosis of fetal intracranial calcifications. A case is presented wherein fetal intracranial calcifications as a result of intrauterine cytomegalovirus infection were visualized by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging at 36 weeks' gestation. Diagnosis of in utero cytomegalovirus infection was made by isolation of the virus from amniotic fluid. No symptomatic abnormality has been noted in the neonatal period except periventricular calcifications. 
nervous system diseases,"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome. When levodopa withdrawal is the cause. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome has been described in patients receiving dopamine antagonists and in a few patients after withdrawal of dopaminergic antiparkinson therapy. Complications affect almost all organ systems and can be life-threatening. Most patients have fever, altered level of consciousness, bradykinesia, and rigidity. Treatment includes withdrawal of the causative agent and supportive therapy for complications. When withdrawal of a dopaminergic medication is the suspected cause, the agent should be reinstated. "
nervous system diseases,"Bacterial or viral meningitis? Measuring lactate in CSF can help you know quickly. Measurement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate is a useful test when properly applied to the appropriate clinical situation and can offer information other CSF parameters cannot provide. Except for Gram's stain of CSF, lactate level is the most important CSF parameter in the early differentiation of viral (aseptic) and bacterial purulent meningitis. "
nervous system diseases,"Visual recovery in patients with optic neuritis and visual loss to no light perception. We reviewed the records of 151 patients with optic neuritis examined over an eight-year period. Of these patients, 12 developed visual acuity of no light perception during the first episode of optic neuritis in the affected eye. Eight of the 12 patients recovered visual acuity of 20/40 or better. Of these, five patients had visual acuity of 20/20 or better, one had visual acuity of 20/25, one had visual acuity of 20/30, and one had visual acuity of 20/40. Four of the 12 patients recovered peripheral visual fields but had dense central scotomas and visual acuity of less than 20/400. Dyschromatopsia persisted after visual recovery in 11 of 12 patients. "
nervous system diseases,"Penetrating craniocerebral trauma. The authors review the pathophysiology of penetrating and perforating cranial wounds. Radiologic evaluation includes computed tomography and angiography. Operative technique and perioperative critical care are discussed, with special emphasis on the control of the intracranial pressure. Other problems such as fluid and electrolyte disorders and nutrition are discussed in relation to neurosurgery. "
nervous system diseases,"A clinical triad to diagnose paraneoplastic retinopathy. Two elderly men developed photosensitivity and light-induced glare, transient visual symptoms, and progressive visual loss several months before small cell carcinoma of the lung was discovered. Both patients had impaired visual acuity and color vision, ring scotomas, and attenuated retinal arteriole caliber. Electroretinography demonstrated abnormal cone and rod-mediated responses. Antiretinal antibodies were identified in their serum. Their visual sensory function improved following therapy with immunosuppressive agents. The triad of photosensitivity, ring scotomatous visual field loss, and attenuated retinal arteriole caliber should alert one to a paraneoplastic disorder affecting the retina. "
nervous system diseases,"Pain control in the ambulatory elderly. Pain control in the elderly, no matter what the etiology or setting, can be a major clinical challenge. Aging causes unique physiologic changes, eg, a decreased perception of pain and an enhanced sensitivity to opioid analgesics. Principles regarding evaluation of patients with pain are reviewed, including the use of an objective instrument for pain assessment from the viewpoint of both physician and patient. Good pain control can be achieved with the nonopioids, such as acetaminophen and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the opioid analgesics, and, in some cases, adjuvant agents. Discussed also are the concerns for patient addiction and the WHO Cancer Pain Relief program. "
nervous system diseases,"Syringomyelia secondary to compression of the cervical spinal cord by an extramedullary lymphoma. A case of syringomyelia secondary to an extramedullary cervical spinal cord compression by a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is described. After radiotherapy, the syrinx was no longer seen. The pathogenesis of this type of syrinx is discussed, and the potential benefit of radiotherapy in these cases is suggested. "
nervous system diseases,Parkinsonian tremor loses its alternating aspect during non-REM sleep and is inhibited by REM sleep. Non-REM sleep transforms the waking alternating Parkinsonian tremor into subclinical repetitive muscle contractions whose amplitude and duration decrease as non-REM sleep progresses from stages I to IV. During REM sleep Parkinsonian tremor disappears while the isolated muscle events increase significantly. 
nervous system diseases,"Familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease without periodic EEG activity. Four members of a kindred with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are reported, in whom myoclonus did not develop and in whom serial electroencephalograms performed late in their illness failed to show periodic sharp wave complexes. Otherwise, the patients' disease duration, clinical features, and neuropathological findings were similar to those described in sporadic cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Our findings and those reported by others suggest that periodic electroencephalographic activity may be rare in familial forms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, as it is in other slow transmissible encephalopathies. "
nervous system diseases,"Indications for thymectomy in myasthenia gravis. Fifty-six board-certified neurologists with interest and expertise in myasthenia completed a survey of indications for thymectomy in myasthenia gravis. Thymectomy was advocated for virtually all patients with thymoma, for a variable subset of patients with generalized myasthenia without thymoma, and occasionally for selected patients with disabling ocular myasthenia. "
nervous system diseases,Accessory arm--dysraphism or disparity? Case report. The case of a 3-month-old infant with an accessory third arm is reported. The extra appendage was attached at the midcervical region and was associated with posterior cervical dysraphism and a cervical cord lipoma. Possible theories of origin are examined. 
nervous system diseases,"Choroid plexus cysts and chromosomal defects During a 4-year period, 83 pregnant women with fetal choroid plexus cysts were investigated in our unit. Abnormal karyotypes were found in 20 fetuses, including trisomy 18 (n = 16), trisomy 13 (n = 1), triploidy (n = 1) and translocation Down's syndrome (n = 2). All fetuses with chromosomal defects had structural malformations in addition to the choroid plexus cysts. "
nervous system diseases,"Pseudopsammomatous meningioma with elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen: a true secretory meningioma. Case report. A sphenoid-wing meningioma in a 60-year-old woman was accompanied by elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, which returned to normal after removal of the tumor. Light microscopic examination revealed a secretory meningioma containing numerous pseudopsammoma bodies and a prominent vascular pattern. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the tumor cells and pseudopsammoma bodies to be CEA-positive. This case illustrates the possibility that secretory meningioma may be associated with clinically detectable secretion of CEA. The report also documents the rare occurrence of elevated serum CEA in a primary benign intracranial tumor. "
nervous system diseases,"L-tryptophan associated eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Environmental chemicals are increasingly incriminated in the pathogenesis of several disease states. The eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome is a recently described entity attributed to the ingestion of the normal dietary amino acid L-tryptophan. We describe a patient who fulfills criteria for the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and who was ingesting supplemental L-tryptophan. Exhaustive investigations failed to reveal other causes for her eosinophilia or her myalgic/neuropathic complaints, and she improved dramatically when she discontinued the L-tryptophan supplements. The mechanisms whereby this chemical may induce this syndrome are discussed. "
nervous system diseases,"Advances in cluster headache. The physician may have to combine the art and science of medicine in the management of this most fascinating of human ailments. The choice of drugs and the length of treatment prescribed are greatly influenced by the individual physician's experience, convictions, and reasoning. Needless to say, chronic use of narcotics should be avoided. The author's own regimen is to use combinations of ergotamine prophylaxis with either verapamil or prednisone in episodic cluster headache and with lithium for chronic cluster headache. Management of the treatment-resistant patient remains problematic, but a carefully performed trigeminal radiofrequency thermocoagulation procedure may be worthwhile. "
nervous system diseases,Concurrent intradural and extradural meningiomas of the cervical spine. A case of an extradural spinal meningioma presenting with a separate intradural meningioma at the same cord level is reported. Review of the English literature on spinal epidural meningiomas reveals a high incidence of concurrent intradural tumors in patients with epidural meningiomas. This leads to the conclusion that the intradural space should be evaluated carefully when an epidural meningioma is encountered. 
nervous system diseases,"Microsaccadic flutter. Microsaccadic flutter is a rare symptomatic saccadic oscillation that has been reported only twice previously. Here we describe 5 patients with this disorder. The oscillation is horizontal, has a frequency of 15-30 Hz, an amplitude of 0.1-0.5 degrees, and cannot be seen with the unaided eye. It is usually not associated with any underlying neurological disorder. We hypothesize that microsaccadic flutter is due to malfunction of the brainstem omnipause neurons. "
nervous system diseases,"Bilateral homonymous visual field defects as initial manifestation of multiple sclerosis. Symptomatic suprageniculate lesions in multiple sclerosis expressed as a visual field defect are infrequent. The present case developed a bilateral homonymous defect as the initial and unique symptom of the disease. It was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, which disclosed extensive demyelinating areas in both optic nerve radiations. The mode of onset, perimetric findings, and unusual presentation of this condition are briefly discussed. "
nervous system diseases,"Physiologic and psychobehavioral research in oncology. A major thrust in research in psychosocial oncology is the study of the interaction of psychologic and physiologic variables. This discussion reviews the current status and future directions of such research. Areas addressed include pain, nausea and vomiting with chemotherapy, sexuality, effects of cancer on psychologic and neuropsychologic function, impact of psychologic factors on cancer and its treatment, and psychoneuroimmunology. In addition, specific recommendations for strategies to facilitate research in these areas of psychosocial oncology are proposed. "
nervous system diseases,"Alcohol-dependent unilateral vestibular impairment persisting after a closed head injury. A 20-year-old man suffered a closed head injury followed by symptoms of right-sided labyrinthine concussion with complete clinical recovery within 3 weeks. Episodic vertigo and ataxic gait occurred after the ingestion of small amounts of alcohol over the next 2 years. Electro-oculography revealed a right-sided peripheral type vestibular lesion, only after taking alcohol. This was interpreted as an alcohol-induced impairment of central compensation following an incomplete recovery from right-sided labyrinthine trauma. "
nervous system diseases,"Loss of consciousness after emergence from anaesthesia. A case of suspected micturition syncope. A case of postanaesthesia micturition syncope with respiratory arrest is described. If syncope occurs, the temporary myocardial ischaemia and cerebral hypoperfusion may increase anaesthetic risk in the marginally compensated patient. The loss of airway protection during the syncopal period is also a cause of concern. We recommend the use of an indwelling bladder catheter during any prolonged surgical procedure. "
nervous system diseases,"Right parietal stroke with Gerstmann's syndrome. Appearance on computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and single-photon emission computed tomography. We examined a patient who exhibited Gerstmann's syndrome (left-right disorientation, finger agnosia, dyscalculia, and dysgraphia) in association with a perioperative stroke in the right parietal lobe. This is the first description of the Gerstmann tetrad occurring in the setting of discrete right hemisphere pathologic findings. A well-localized vascular lesion was demonstrated by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and single-photon emission computed tomographic studies. The patient had clinical evidence of reversed functional cerebral dominance and radiologic evidence of reversed anatomic cerebral asymmetries. "
nervous system diseases,"Liver failure occurring as a component of exertional heatstroke. An unusual case of an exertional heatstroke in a healthy 25-year-old man is presented. Initially, the patient was deeply comatose and developed severe rhabdomyolysis and massive hepatic necrosis. Subsequently, he received a liver transplant with remarkable improvement in his mental status, although the rhabdomyolysis continued. The patient died 41 days after the transplant due to a complicating infection. Providing that infections can be effectively controlled, liver transplants might be a promising therapeutic alternative for the few patients who survive the initial neurological consequences of this unusual event. "
nervous system diseases,AAEM case report #1: ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. A patient with bilateral cubital syndrome complicated by anomalous innervation is presented. The electrodiagnostic approach to patients with this neuropathy is reviewed emphasizing new developments. The interpretation of the findings in this patient centers around issues of pathophysiology and methodology. 
nervous system diseases,"Phenytoin toxicity due to interaction with clobazam. The benzodiazepine antiepileptic drug clobazam can be added to existing AED treatment, usually without clinical toxicity. We report 3 patients in whom the addition of clobazam led within several weeks to clinically obvious phenytoin (PHT) intoxication in patients who had been taking maximum tolerable PHT doses. Symptoms and high PHT levels resolved with lowering the PHT dose. Clobazam and norclobazam levels were not elevated. This interaction is probably related to interference with hepatic degradation of PHT. Clinicians should be aware of possible PHT intoxication in patients starting clobazam. "
nervous system diseases,"Deletion of Alu sequences in the fifth c-sis intron in individuals with meningiomas. An abnormality in the c-sis protooncogene was identified in leukocyte DNA from members of a family predisposed to the development of meningioma, and was found to be associated with the development of the tumor in those individuals. Molecular analysis of this abnormality demonstrated a deletion within the fifth intron of the c-sis gene. The normal c-sis gene has an Alu sequence in this region which includes two perfect 130 nucleotide repeated sequences separated by 5 bp. The deleted c-sis allele is missing precisely one copy of the 130 bp repeat and the intervening 5 bp. An identical deletion was also found in DNA from 1 of 13 sporadic meningiomas. "
nervous system diseases,"Pulse oximetry during apparent tonic-clonic seizures. A pulse oximeter was used to monitor arterial oxygen saturations in 11 patients during apparent tonic-clonic seizures. 8 had a clinical diagnosis of genuine fits, 6 of whom showed striking falls in oxygen saturation during the seizures. 3 had a clinical diagnosis of pseudoseizures, none of whom had hypoxia during these episodes. Pulse oximetry during apparent tonic-clonic seizures may help to identify patients with low arterial oxygen tension who need immediate intervention. "
nervous system diseases,"Cerebellar syndrome caused by isoniazid. Treatment of tuberculosis in a hemodialysis patient with isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide resulted in the development of acute cerebellar dysfunction. This resolved rapidly following the discontinuation of isoniazid and pyrazinamide, reinstitution of isoniazid at a lower dose, and addition of pyridoxine. We discuss why we believe this syndrome was caused by isoniazid. Patients with renal failure who undergo antituberculous therapy with isoniazid should receive supplemental pyridoxine to reduce the likelihood of isoniazid-related neurotoxicity. "
nervous system diseases,Neurologic complications of cocaine abuse. The neurologic complications of cocaine toxicity are responsible for a major portion of the morbidity and mortality associated with cocaine. Most of the complications appear to be related to the hyperadrenergic state induced by cocaine and may be treated symptomatically. Diazepam is the most effective drug for cocaine-induced seizures. 
nervous system diseases,"Syphilitic meningomyelitis. A 28-year-old nonimmunocompromised man developed secondary syphilis confirmed by serum and CSF findings. His course was complicated by chorioretinitis, extensive skin lesions, and spastic paraparesis secondary to syphilitic meningomyelitis. MRI of the spinal cord was strikingly abnormal. "
nervous system diseases,"Excipients in valproic acid syrup may cause diarrhea: a case report. A 5-year-old child receiving valproic acid syrup for seizure control developed diarrhea probably from the excipient ingredients. Each 5 mL of valproic acid syrup contains sucrose 3 g, glycerin 0.75 g, and sorbitol 0.75 g, providing daily amounts of 36, 9, and 9 g of sucrose, glycerin, and sorbitol, respectively. The diarrhea resolved when the child was switched to another valproic acid product. Clinicians should be aware of potential problems that may occur from excipient ingredients in pharmaceutical products when evaluating adverse effects of medications. "
nervous system diseases,Oromandibular disorders and headache. A critical appraisal. Oromandibular disorders are functional disorders and associated pains in the anatomic region of the temporomandibular joint. Their diagnosis and treatment are controversial because of the lack of conformity concerning these disorders among health care providers. This article provides a clear classification of these disorders and critically reviews their evaluation and treatment. 
nervous system diseases,"Management of arginine monohydrochloride extravasation in the forearm. We initially observed our patient, who had subcutaneous arginine monohydrochloride extravasation in the volar forearm, until his wound demarcation was complete. After wound demarcation, we proceeded with debridement and partial-thickness skin grafting. Upper extremity function was totally normal 3 months after this therapy. This is the first case report in the literature that describes a child with an arginine monohydrochloride-induced extravasation necrosis. "
nervous system diseases,"The comportmental learning disabilities of early frontal lobe damage. Two adult patients are described who suffered bilateral prefrontal damage early in life and who subsequently came to psychiatric attention because of severely aberrant behaviour. A battery of developmental psychology paradigms (not previously used to assess neurologically impaired individuals) showed that social and moral development of these 2 patients was arrested at an immature stage. In comparison with other types of brain damage which disrupt cognitive development, frontal damage acquired early in life appears to provide the neurological substrate for a special type of learning disability in the realms of insight, foresight, social judgement, empathy, and complex reasoning. "
nervous system diseases,"Polyglucosan body disease. Adult polyglucosan disease has been described in 15 cases. All had signs of peripheral neuropathy, upper motor neuron signs, and 12 of the 15 had sphincter problems. Dementia was prominent in 8 of 15 cases. We reported 2 cases that contained these clinical features. Electrophysiological studies showed axonal neuropathy. Somatosensory evoked potentials on the second patient were abnormal. Sural nerve biopsy showed clusters of polyglucosan bodies. Although the presence of polyglucosan bodies in biopsy is nonspecific, the number as well as the clinical features are necessary to make the diagnosis. Branching enzyme activity in muscle extracts of the muscles were normal. Hence, a specific enzyme abnormality is not yet known. "
nervous system diseases,"Acute pain relief. Pain is a multidimensional psychophysiologic phenomenon. Systematic multidimensional assessment is an essential first component of an effective plan to relieve the pain. Nurses are key to effective pain management because of the close, 24-hour-a-day relationship with the hospitalized patient. It is the nurse who is most critical to the adequate assessment of pain, to the implementation of the treatment plan, and to the evaluation of efficacy. Nurses should continue to develop a better knowledge base about pain and pain therapies and assessment skills, be assertive in obtaining effective treatment for their patients, and perceive themselves as responsible for pain relief. "
nervous system diseases,"Cyst of the choroid plexus in the lateral ventricle: case report and review of the literature. We report an intraventricular cyst in a 2-year-old boy who had myoclonic jerks of the extremities. The cyst had no communication with the ventricular system or subarachnoid space. Total removal of the cyst adhering to the choroid plexus was accomplished. The glial cyst wall was lined in part by flattened or cuboidal epithelium. The preoperative and postoperative computed tomographic scans and magnetic resonance images are presented, and congenital benign cysts in the lateral ventricle are reviewed and discussed. "
nervous system diseases,"Toxoplasmosis of the conus medullaris in a patient with hemophilia A-associated AIDS. Case report. Toxoplasma gondii has been reported to be the most common cause of focal brain lesions in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). A case of intramedullary toxoplasmosis of the conus medullaris is reported in a patient with hemophilia A-associated AIDS. The diagnosis is discussed, with particular emphasis on the magnetic resonance imaging appearance. "
nervous system diseases,"Shunt nephritis. Case report. The incidence of shunt nephritis has decreased over the past several years due to the increased use of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts rather than the ventriculovascular systems for which this complication was originally reported in 1965. Despite this trend, the syndrome has been reported in cases of VP shunting and, for this reason, merit a renewed look. Shunt nephritis is thought to be secondary to immune complex formation and deposition in the kidney in response to Staphylococcus epidermidis. The diagnostic workup and management of this disease is discussed. "
nervous system diseases,"Steroid anabolic drugs and arterial complications in an athlete--a case history. Serious side effects and complications have been attributed to anabolic and androgenic steroids when used for medical reasons or when taken in sports in hopes of increasing strength and, hence, performance. The author presents a case of an athlete who experienced two metachronous arterial complications after taking these drugs: a cerebrovascular accident caused by a carotid artery thrombus that partially embolized to the brain and, later, a severe ischemic episode in a lower limb caused by a diffused distal arterial thrombosis. This patient represents the first reported case of vascular events in an otherwise healthy athlete taking androgens to increase his skeletal muscle mass. "
nervous system diseases,Mistaken diagnoses in continuous muscle fiber activity of peripheral nerve origin. The syndrome of continuous muscle fiber activity of peripheral nerve origin has manifestations that resemble those of many other more common neurologic disorders during childhood and infancy. This similarity often leads to misdiagnosis when an adequate index of suspicion is not entertained and a comprehensive electromyographic examination is not performed. Two affected patients from 1 family are reported to illustrate the type of diagnostic errors that were made before the establishment of the correct diagnosis. 
nervous system diseases,"Cheilitis granulomatosa: report of six cases and review of the literature. Six cases of cheilitis granulomatosa, a rare inflammatory disorder of unknown origin, are reported. The condition produces nontender, persistent swelling of one or both lips and affects primarily young adults. Histologically, nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation is seen. The clinical findings and results of therapy in these six cases are presented. One patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate (Plaquenil) that stabilized the process. One of our patients had vesicular-appearing lesions. Microscopic examination showed the lesions to be dilated superficial lymphatic channels, a finding that to our knowledge has not been previously described. "
nervous system diseases,"Continuous muscle fiber activity, peripheral neuropathy, and thymoma. Two patients, one of them with myasthenia gravis, presented symptoms of continuous muscle fiber activity syndrome before discovery of a thymoma. Peripheral neuropathy was present in both patients, with axonal and demyelinating lesions in sural nerve biopsy. The syndrome remained unchanged or worse after thymectomy. Both patients died of associated complications. "
nervous system diseases,"Determination of ventricular fluid outflow resistance in patients with ventriculomegaly. Resorption of the ventricular fluid was studied by measuring ventricular fluid outflow resistance during steady state 1.5 and 5.0 ml/min infusions in 26 patients with substantial enlargement of the supratentorial ventricular system. This test may avoid unnecessary use of shunts, but a shunt could be introduced during the same procedure. "
nervous system diseases,"Articulatory impairment associated with tardive dyskinesia. The speech of two patients with tardive dyskinesia was studied, and one neuroleptic-treated patient having no signs of overt tardive dyskinesia served as control. A structured interview, including reading, repetition of sentences, and spontaneous conversation, was performed. A phonetic transcription and analysis of abnormal phonemes was done by a linguist under blind conditions. Both patients with tardive dyskinesia had abnormal phonemes whereas the control patient had none. These differences could not be explained by age, direct neuroleptic effect, or neuroleptic exposure time. The abnormal phonemes were all consonants. The authors conclude that tardive dyskinesia may cause articulatory communication problems. "
nervous system diseases,Syringomyelia as a postoperative sequela of the resection of a chordoma of the clivus: case report. Syringomyelia has been described frequently in association with various abnormalities of the skull base but rarely with tumors of the skull base. Syringomyelia as a postoperative sequela of surgery of the skull base has not been reported. The authors describe a case of cervical syringomyelia developing after the partial resection of a chordoma and combined conventional and proton beam irradiation. The possible mechanisms causing this abnormality are discussed. 
nervous system diseases,HTLV-I viral-associated myelopathy after blood transfusion in a multiple trauma patient. This may be the first documented case in the United States and in the orthopedic literature of transfusion-transmitted human T-cell leukemia virus Type I (HTLV-I)-associated myelopathy (HAM). Progressive myelopathy occurred in a 58-year-old white man with serologic and molecular evidence of HTLV-I infection after multiple trauma and subsequent transfusion with multiple units of banked blood products. Symptoms of myelopathy occurred 15 months after the transfusions. Myelopathy from HTLV-I infection simulates a disorder of orthopedic interest. Physicians should be aware of the symptoms of HAM and unexplained myelopathy. 
nervous system diseases,"Use of intravenous stilbestrol diphosphate in patients with prostatic carcinoma refractory to conventional hormonal manipulation. The patient presenting with severe bone pain after primary hormonal therapy, with vertebral collapse, or with uremia resulting from ureteric obstruction should be considered for intravenous stilbestrol diphosphate therapy. The urologist can expect early marked improvement in the patients' mobility and pain, with a reduction in analgesic requirements, from a single 7-day course of treatment. In addition, the drug is inexpensive and free of the side effects commonly associated with cytotoxic therapy. Accurate monitoring of the response is possible with serum prostate-specific antigen measurements, which also enable further therapy to be planned efficiently. "
nervous system diseases,Epidural haematoma requiring surgical decompression following repeated cervical epidural steroid injections for chronic pain. We report a case of epidural haematoma following a steroid injection into the cervical epidural space. The complication occurred on the seventh such injection over a 2 year period for chronic spinal pain. Surgical decompression over the seventh cervical and the upper 3 thoracic vertebrae was required to alleviate the symptoms of paralysis and anaesthesia. The patient subsequently required skin grafting to the surgical site and two trans-urethral resections of the prostate gland during his 6 week hospital admission. He made a full recovery. 
nervous system diseases,"Lyme disease: neurologic and ophthalmic manifestations. Lyme disease is tick-borne infection which produces early and late manifestations in many organ systems. Prominent symptoms and signs occur in skin, heart, joints and nervous system. Many ocular and neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities recently have been attributed to Lyme disease, but some cases have not been well established as direct sequelae. This review of the contemporary state of knowledge about Lyme disease was undertaken so that more rigorous criteria can be applied in future diagnosis. "
nervous system diseases,"Fourth ventricular schwannoma. Case report. A schwannoma arising from the dorsum of the pontomedullary junction and presenting as an exophytic mass in the fourth ventricle is described. A ventricular schwannoma has not previously been reported in the literature. The presenting clinical and radiographic features and the pathology of this tumor are summarized, and an explanation is sought for its unusual location. "
nervous system diseases,"Slow release carbamazepine in treatment of poorly controlled seizures. Thirty three children with poorly controlled epilepsy, and six new patients, were treated with slow release carbamazepine. Twelve of the former had a reduction in the number of seizures of more than half, and 10 had fewer side effects. Three of the new patients stopped having seizures. Variations in plasma concentrations between doses was significantly less when patients took the slow release preparation (22%) compared with the standard preparation (41%). Slow release carbamazepine may improve the conditions of children whose seizures are poorly controlled. "
nervous system diseases,"Manifestations of migraine. Migraine is a disorder with multiple manifestations affecting the circulation, gastrointestinal tract, and the central nervous system. Involvement of the autonomic nervous system is responsible for many of the clinical features. An attack of migraine can vary from a fragment of the clinical spectrum to one with several phases and potentially permanent sequelae. "
nervous system diseases,Inconsistent response to divalproex sodium in hemichorea/hemiballism. We report 6 patients with hemichorea/hemiballism of vascular origin who were treated with divalproex sodium (Depakote). Four of 6 responded initially. Marked improvement was seen in 2 patients only and in 1 of these hemiballism recurred despite continuing therapy. Divalproex sodium is not uniformly effective in the treatment of hemichorea/hemiballism. 
nervous system diseases,"Tension pneumocephalus: treatment with controlled decompression via a closed water-seal drainage system. Case report. The successful treatment of a patient with tension pneumocephalus by controlled decompression via external drainage is described. The advantage of the technique includes the immediate release of high pressure and the capability of maintaining constant low pressure to enable and facilitate sealing of dural tears. The method has been used in three other patients, leading to resolution of the tension pneumocephalus without recurrence or other complications. "
nervous system diseases,"Neurinoma in the cavernous sinus: report of two cases. Two cases of trigeminal neurinoma located solely in the cavernous sinus are reported. Preoperatively, magnetic resonance imaging provided the accurate localization of the lesions, allowing precise planning of the surgical approach, that is, a subtemporal lateral approach and a pterional superior approach, respectively. The neurinomas inside the cavernous sinus were removed successfully, and the patients developed no new neurological deficits except for anesthesia in the 1st division of the trigeminal nerve. The characteristic magnetic resonance imaging findings of trigeminal neurinoma in the cavernous sinus are presented, and the different surgical approaches are discussed. "
nervous system diseases,"Sleep apnoea syndrome associated with maxillofacial abnormalities. Four cases with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS) are presented. They consisted of two cases with TMJ ankylosis with micrognathia, one case with Treacher Collins Syndrome, and one case with the Long Face Syndrome. Standard and specific cephalometric parameters were obtained to detect the site of the obstruction. Polysomnographic studies yielded information regarding the patient's sleep-wake state, respiratory and cardiac functioning, pre- and post-operatively. A temporary tracheostomy corrected the symptoms in one patient but the syndrome recurred when it was closed. Surgical correction of the maxillofacial anomalies will re-establish normal sleep patterns preventing OSAS. "
nervous system diseases,"Optimal wound closure after tethered cord correction. Technical note. A technique of wound closure following tethered cord correction is presented that significantly reduces the incidence of cerebrospinal fluid collections in the subcutaneous space. In over 60 cases, the described method of fascia and skin closure has lessened wound problems to a minimal level. Patient hospitalization time has also been greatly diminished. "
nervous system diseases,"Effect of plasmapheresis on serum and CSF autoantibody levels in CNS paraneoplastic syndromes. We compared the effect of plasmapheresis on antineuronal autoantibody titers in the serum and CSF of 3 patients with CNS paraneoplastic syndromes. Plasmapheresis reduced the serum autoantibody titer to 20% of the initial levels in the 3 patients, but the CSF autoantibody titer decreased only in the patient with severe damage of the blood-brain barrier. "
nervous system diseases,"Arterial responses during migraine headache. The superficial temporal artery has been thought to be the main focus of pain during migraine attacks, but its diameter has never been measured directly. The use of a new, high-resolution ultrasound machine to measure arterial size in 25 migraine patients with unilateral head pain showed that the lumen was wider on the painful than on the non-painful side during a migraine attack. The diameters of both radial arteries and the temporal artery on the non-painful side were smaller during than between attacks. The generalised vasoconstriction was not shared by the temporal artery on the affected side, which suggests a local vasodilatory response. The findings suggest that cephalic arteries may play a role in migraine pathogenesis. "
nervous system diseases,"Stroke after heavy marijuana smoking. I examined two young men who developed cerebral infarction associated with heavy marijuana smoking. Both were light tobacco smokers, but they did not drink alcohol or use other street drugs. Diagnostic work-up for nonatherosclerotic causes of stroke was unremarkable. I postulate that marijuana-associated alterations in systemic blood pressure resulted in vasospasm, leading to strokes in these patients. "
nervous system diseases,"Untying the gordian knot: the genetics of Tourette syndrome. A review of the current status of the genetics of Tourette syndrome is presented. Over the course of the 104 years since Gilles de la Tourette described the syndrome that bears his name, a body of carefully collected, described, and analyzed data has produced a model of the genetics that implicates a single dominant gene that is variably penetrant in males and females. Moreover, the locus of action of this gene is most likely in the dopaminergic system of the midbrain. A systematic search for this gene using recombinant DNA techniques is under way. "
nervous system diseases,"An early description of slowly progressive aphasia. Slowly progressive aphasia without generalized dementia has become an important issue of present-day neuropsychological research. Historically, credit for the first description is usually given to Pick. Another German-speaking author who has published a vivid description of a pertinent cases is Pick's contemporary, Max Rosenfeld. This author has also observed a patient with slowly progressive spatial disorientation and visual recognition deficit, and he has discussed these patients in a remarkably modern way in the context of partial atrophy of the brain. "
nervous system diseases,Hematoma of the optic nerve sheath after penetrating trauma. We have presented a case involving the diagnosis and management of optic nerve sheath hematoma. Our patient's positive outcome demonstrates the usefulness of megadose steroid therapy for acute optic nerve injury. 
nervous system diseases,"Occlusive arterial disease as a form of presentation of homocystinuria. Homocystinuria was first described in 1962. The disease affects several systems including the eyes, skeletal and nervous and vascular systems. We present the case of a 28-year old woman who presented with a severe occlusive arteriopathy. Screening for the most usual causes of arterial disease in young patients was negative, but a study of aminoaciduria and column chromatography confirmed the diagnosis of B6-responsive homocystinuria. Although it was necessary to amputate her left leg, the patient remains asymptomatic 16 months after B6 therapy was started. "
nervous system diseases,Postauricular cerebellar encephalocoele secondary to chronic suppurative otitis media and mastoid surgery. Cerebellar herniation into the mastoid through the posterior aspect of the temporal bone as a result of chronic suppurative otitis media and mastoid surgery is a rare event. A case is reported in which such a hernia presented subcutaneously behind the pinna; its repair is discussed. 
nervous system diseases,"Recurrent lateral rectus palsy in childhood. Five patients with recurrent, lateral rectus palsy in childhood, examined at the University of Iowa Hospitals over a period of 22 years, are reported. During the same period, 131 abducens nerve palsy patients, younger than 18 years of age, were evaluated. Eighteen similar patients, most single case reports, are reviewed from the literature. All reported patients, including our own, shared the following features: spontaneous recovery within 6 months in the majority of patients, ipsilateral recurrence, and painless palsy. There is female and left-sided preponderance. Etiology is undetermined. Hypotheses include viral etiology, neurovascular compression by aberrant artery, and migraine. "
nervous system diseases,"Celiac disease, brain atrophy, and dementia. We report 5 patients who developed dementia before age 60 and were subsequently found to have celiac disease (CD). Intellectual deterioration ranged from moderate to severe, and diffuse cerebral or cerebellar atrophy was found on brain CT. Diagnosis of CD was confirmed by findings of subtotal villous atrophy in jejunal biopsy specimens and positive serum reticulin and gliadin antibodies. Conspicuously, gastrointestinal symptoms were mild. The gluten-free diet failed to improve the neurologic disability except in 1 patient. CD is a multisystem disorder and may play a role in some cases of presenile dementia. Although the pathogenetic mechanisms are obscure, immunologic mechanisms are implicated. "
nervous system diseases,"Alexia without agraphia associated with spleniogeniculate infarction. Pure alexia, following an infarction in the distribution of the left posterior cerebral artery, is attributed to damage of the left occipital lobe and the splenium of the corpus callosum. We describe a case of pure alexia in a 57-year-old woman with infarction of the left lateral geniculate body and the splenium of the corpus callosum, a variation on this classic disconnection syndrome. "
nervous system diseases,Neuroanatomy of fragile X syndrome: the posterior fossa. The occurrence and specificity of posterior fossa abnormalities as measured from magnetic resonance images of the brain were investigated in a group of 14 males with fragile X syndrome and comparison groups consisting of 17 males with other causes of developmental disability and 18 males with normal IQs. The size of the posterior cerebellar vermis was significantly decreased and the fourth ventricle significantly increased in the group of males with fragile X syndrome compared with males in both comparison groups. These neuroanatomical abnormalities appeared to be secondary to hypoplasia rather than atrophy. 
nervous system diseases,"Normeperidine-induced seizures in hereditary coproporphyria. Seizures are common in acute exacerbations of hepatic porphyria, even though the etiology is not identified in most cases. We have reported a case of normeperidine-induced seizures in a patient with hereditary coproporphyria. Although meperidine is commonly used for pain control during acute attacks in these patients, this report suggests that meperidine is not a good analgesic choice in porphyria. Normeperidine-induced seizures in patients with porphyria may be treated by withdrawal of meperidine therapy and selective use of anticonvulsants. "
nervous system diseases,The use of cognitive behavior therapy with a normalizing rationale in schizophrenia. Preliminary report. Sixty-four consecutively referred patients with schizophrenia were treated with cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy as an adjunct to standard treatment. A destigmatizing rationale to explain symptom emergence was devised and supplemented these techniques. They proved safe to use and appeared acceptable to patients and their relatives. Members of the group are being maintained on low levels of or no medication and have required minimal hospitalization. The techniques used are described in detail. 
nervous system diseases,"Primary intratemporal tumours of the facial nerve: diagnosis and treatment. Benign primary tumours of the facial nerve are uncommon. A slowly progressive facial palsy should be considered the result of a nerve tumour until proven otherwise. Improvements in diagnostic imaging techniques of the temporal bone have increased the possibility of a correct pre-operative diagnosis but facial nerve tumours remain a frequently ignored or misdiagnosed entity as a consequence of their subtle and protean clinical manifestations. A series of 12 cases of primary facial nerve tumours is presented. The clinical features, diagnostic modalities and treatment are discussed in relation to a review of the literature. "
nervous system diseases,"Intradural chordoma of the tentorium cerebelli. Case report. A rare case of intradural chordoma is described. The literature contains seven examples of intradural extraosseous chordoma, all reported in a ventral location. This is the first reported case of a primary intradural chordoma distant from the clivus and involving both the supra- and infratentorial compartments. "
nervous system diseases,"Shy-Drager syndrome. Effect of fludrocortisone and L-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine on the blood pressure and regional cerebral blood flow. In nine cases of Shy-Drager syndrome, the changes in blood pressure and cerebral blood flow on sitting up from a supine position were studied. The influence of fludrocortisone, a synthetic mineralocorticoid, and L-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine (DOPS), a precursor of norepinephrine, on these changes was examined. On sitting up, the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measured by Xe133 inhalation showed a tendency to decrease. Fludrocortisone reduced the fall of the mean blood pressure significantly. DOPS reduced the fall of both the diastolic blood pressure and rCBF significantly. "
nervous system diseases,"Familial autosomal recessive rigid spine syndrome with neurogenic facio-scapulo-peroneal muscle atrophy. Two sisters and a first cousin presented with rigid spine and facio-scapulo-peroneal muscle atrophy. The patients belonged to a family with two first-cousin marriages. Electromyography, muscle and nerve biopsy showed neurogenic muscle atrophy without peripheral nerve involvement. Follow up did not show progression of the disease. This is the first observation of an association of neurogenic facio-scapulo-peroneal and rigid spine syndrome. The double first-cousin marriage suggests autosomal recessive inheritance. "
nervous system diseases,"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Although the cause of IIH remains obscure, loss of visual function is common, and patients may progress to blindness. Diagnosis should adhere to the modified Dandy criteria. Recent case-control studies cast doubt on the validity of many frequently cited conditions associated with IIH. Valid associations include obesity, recent weight gain, female sex, vitamin A intoxication, and steroid withdrawal. Management should include serial perimetry using a sensitive disease-specific strategy so the proper therapy can be selected and visual loss prevented or reversed. "
nervous system diseases,"Proximal posterior cerebral artery occlusion simulating middle cerebral artery occlusion. We describe 12 cases of acute stroke in which clinical features of proximal posterior cerebral artery occlusion simulated the clinical syndrome of middle cerebral artery occlusion. The majority of patients developed contralateral hemiparesis, homonymous hemianopia, hemispatial neglect, and sensory loss or sensory inattention. All 8 patients with dominant hemisphere lesions were aphasic. Accurate diagnosis in each case was achieved only after a head CT, showing occipital lobe, thalamic, and inferomesial temporal lobe infarction. ""Cortical"" signs are probably explained by thalamic involvement. Recognition of this syndrome has implications for management and prognosis. "
nervous system diseases,Spinal man after declaration of brain death Complex spinal automatism in a patient who was declared brain dead is described. These movements tend to appear once cerebrospinal shock has abated. We postulate that these manifestations are a reflection of the physiological potential of the isolated spinal cord. These spinal movements should be included in the revised guidelines for the determination of cerebral death. 
nervous system diseases,"Acceleration of scrapie in trisomy 16----diploid aggregation chimeras. We studied the susceptibility to prion infection of the trisomy 16----diploid chimeric mouse, a putative model of Down syndrome. When weanling chimeras were inoculated intracerebrally with scrapie prions, the time until appearance of the first symptoms of scrapie was reduced by 17 days (from a mean control time of 153 days) and the time to death was reduced by 30 days (from control time of 170 days). Our results with trisomy 16 chimeras argue that the susceptibility to central nervous system degeneration caused by prions can be modulated by chromosome imbalance. "
nervous system diseases,"Blood flow direction in the lumbar nerve root. The effect of clipping on lumbar nerve root blood flow rates in the region of the nerve root canal was studied experimentally in the hog. Blood flow rate was measured using the hydrogen washout technique. When the entrance zone was clipped with a microvascular clip, blood flow rate of the nerve root was decreased by 37% in comparison with the initial control rate; clipping at the exit zone reduced blood flow rate by 69%. Blood flow direction in the lumbar nerve root within the nerve root canal was found to be predominantly proximal. The current data indicate that the more lateral the impingement of the nerve root occurs, the more ischemic changes are induced. "
nervous system diseases,"The floppy infant: recent advances in the understanding of disorders affecting the neuromuscular junction. The clinician is often asked to evaluate the floppy infant. Numerous conditions that cause hypotonia in infancy are briefly outlined in this article. These conditions may affect the brain, spinal cord, or motor unit. Several disorders of neuromuscular transmission, including four distinct and recently described congenital myasthenic syndromes and infant botulism, are discussed thereafter. "
nervous system diseases,"South American blastomycosis: ophthalmic and oculomotor nerve lesions. A case of South American blastomycosis began with an oropharyngeal lesion which was followed by a granulomatous uveitis. The patient was treated with Amphotericin B and showed a clinical regression. Four months later, he developed a right 3rd cranial nerve palsy, aggravating the clinical aspect with a severe generalized involvement of the central nervous system and death. Necropsy showed blastomycotic meningoencephalitis. "
nervous system diseases,"Spinal hemangioblastoma, syrinx, and hydrocephalus in a two-year-old child. A two-year-old child presented with an acute inability to bear weight. Radiological investigation revealed a large cervicothoracolumbar syrinx of no known cause. During investigation, acute communicating hydrocephalus developed, which required a shunt. At surgery, a small thoracic spinal cord hemangioblastoma was discovered and excised. Complete recovery with collapse of the syrinx followed. The clinical features of this rare childhood tumor and its associated effects are discussed. "
nervous system diseases,"Regional variation in brain lactate in Leigh syndrome by localized 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Localized water-suppressed 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed in an 11-month-old infant with Leigh syndrome. Spectra obtained from the basal ganglia, occipital cortex, and brainstem showed elevations in lactate, which were most pronounced in regions where abnormalities were seen with routine T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. This approach has allowed us to examine metabolism in brain tissue directly and noninvasively, and may provide a sensitive means for evaluating metabolic disease and the response to therapy in the brain. "
nervous system diseases,Mandibular osteomyelitis in a patient with sickle cell anemia: report of case. A case is presented in which mandibular osteomyelitis and mental nerve paresthesia developed in a patient with sickle cell anemia. This infection appeared to precipitate a sickle cell crisis. The mechanisms for these patients' propensity to infection and the diagnosis and management of sickle cell osteomyelitis of the jaws are discussed. 
nervous system diseases,"Anisocoria in the pigmentary dispersion syndrome We studied four patients with anisocoria and the pigmentary dispersion syndrome. In all patients, the larger pupil was on the side of the greater iris transillumination. The amount of anisocoria was between 0.5 and 1.5 mm and was the same in both the light and dark. There was no blepharoptosis, and all pupils dilated normally with cocaine. All of the patients were young men with myopia, and one patient had increased intraocular pressure. "
nervous system diseases,"Status epilepticus in infancy and childhood. Status epilepticus implies a prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures with persistent decreased consciousness, lasting at least 30 minutes. Both convulsive and nonconvulsive forms exist, either of which may lead to death or additional neurologic deficit. Therapy involves careful supportive care plus some combination of benzodiazepines, phenytoin, or phenobarbital. The outcome depends first on the etiology and second on the rapidity with which seizures are controlled. "
nervous system diseases,"Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. The mitochondrial diseases present with great heterogeneity. They are often multisystemic and vary considerably in age at onset, distribution of weakness, severity, and course. Only nonthyroidal hypermetabolism has a distinctive clinical presentation. Therefore, attempts at classification have generated some controversy. This article discusses the general classification that takes into account genetic and biochemical features, which has resulted from the fast pace of biochemical and molecular genetic investigations. "
nervous system diseases,Unusual presentation of squamous cell carcinoma of the middle ear and mastoid. An unusual case of squamous cell carcinoma of the middle ear and mastoid in which syncope was a major presenting feature is reported. No such case has been reported in the literature. A possible explanation is offered. 
nervous system diseases,Value of magnetic resonance imaging in spontaneous extradural spinal hematoma due to vascular malformation: case report. A case of spinal cord compression due to spontaneous extradural spinal hematoma is reported. A spinal arteriovenous malformation was suspected on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging. Early surgical exploration allowed a complete neurological recovery. The vascular malformation was histopathologically confirmed. The role of magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of acute spinal cord compression syndromes is stressed. 
nervous system diseases,"Childhood stroke after minor neck trauma: case report. Cerebral infarction after minor trauma to the neck has rarely been reported. A case is presented of a child with trauma to the vertebrobasilar artery resulting in stroke. Computerized tomography scan and angiography results are presented. Despite two subsequent, separate transient episodes of vertigo, the child had good functional recovery with complete restoration of language and cognitive function. After 28 months, residual impairments identified were a mild right-sided ataxia and hemiparesis. "
nervous system diseases,"The management of the painful first metatarsophalangeal joint in the older patient. Arthrodesis or Keller's arthroplasty? We report a prospective randomised trial comparing Keller's arthroplasty and arthrodesis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint for the management of symptomatic hallux valgus and hallux rigidus in the older patient. In 81 patients (110 feet), with a minimum of two years follow-up, both procedures gave a similar degree of patient satisfaction and symptom relief. The incidence of metatarsalgia was also similar. As there were no obvious advantages to arthrodesis, and since six out of 50 arthrodesed toes required revision, we suggest that Keller's arthroplasty is the better operation in these patients. "
nervous system diseases,"Anticardiolipin antibodies: a study of frequency in TIA and stroke. We undertook a prospective study of consecutive patients to determine the frequency of elevated IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies in transient ischemic attack and ischemic stroke and found elevated IgG antibodies in 8.2% (9 of 110) and IgM in 9.1% (10 of 110), only the former being significantly greater than in a healthy control population. We suggest that anticardiolipin screening be concentrated on the young. "
nervous system diseases,"Progressive degeneration of the right temporal lobe studied with positron emission tomography. A 79 year old man with a twelve year progressive history of prosopagnosia and recent naming difficulty, in whom other intellectual skills were preserved, is described. Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed an area of right temporal lobe hypometabolism, with an additional area of less severe hypometabolism at the left temporal pole. This may represent an example of progressive focal cortical degeneration similar to that associated with primary progressive dysphasia, but affecting the right temporal lobe. "
nervous system diseases,"Continuous papaveretum infusion for the control of pain in painful sickling crisis. We describe our experience of using continuous papaveretum infusions to control pain in 24 children admitted on 45 occasions with painful sickling crisis. The children were aged from 1.7 to 14.3 years. Infusion duration ranged from one to nine days (median three days), total dose from 0.3 to 21 mg/kg (median 2.4 mg/kg), with a pronounced tendency for dosage to increase with increasing age. No respiratory depression was observed. One infusion was discontinued because of cerebral toxicity. "
nervous system diseases,"Alkalinisation of prilocaine for intravenous regional anaesthesia. Suitability for clinical use. Eighty unpremedicated patients undergoing day-case hand surgery under intravenous regional anaesthesia were randomly allocated to receive, in a double-blind study, either 40 ml 0.75% prilocaine hydrochloride, with 5 ml 8.4% sodium bicarbonate or 5 ml 0.9% saline. The alkalinised group had significantly less pain on injection (p = 0.0045), during surgery (p = 0.0074) and 5 minutes after the tourniquet was deflated (p = 0.0027). The time elapsed between insertion of the block and commencement of surgery was not affected. "
nervous system diseases,"Occult, bilateral anterior sacral and intrasacral meningeal and perineurial cysts: case report and review of the literature. None of the more than 180 cases of anterior sacral meningocele reported in the past 150 years has been bilateral, and only two have been associated with occult intrasacral meningocele. We report a unique case of bilateral anterior sacral cysts, communicating with the subarachnoid space, associated with occult intrasacral meningeal and perineurial (Tarlov's) cysts, in an asymptomatic woman. The pertinent clinical and diagnostic imaging literature is reviewed. "
nervous system diseases,"Reciprocal inhibition between forearm muscles in spastic hemiplegia. We studied reciprocal inhibition of H-reflexes in the forearm flexor and extensor muscles in 14 patients with spastic hemiplegia secondary to a focal cerebral lesion and 14 normal volunteers. In the spastic limb, the Hmax/Mmax ratio was increased in both flexor and particularly extensor wrist muscles. The 3 normal inhibitory phases of reciprocal inhibition between extensor and flexor forearm muscles were markedly reduced on the spastic side of patients. The early disynaptic phase showed the greatest alteration. Reduced or absent inhibition between forearm muscles associated with increased spinal motoneuron excitability may be typical to spastic hemiplegia. "
nervous system diseases,Extradural haematoma in the Irish Republic: an analysis of 82 cases with emphasis on 'delay'. Eighty-two cases of extradural haematoma were analysed to elucidate the factors contributing to delay in treatment and poor outcome. The majority of cases occurred in the first three decades of life with falls being the commonest aetiological factor. Five distinct modes of presentation are described. Excessive delay occurred in recognizing the condition and in subsequent transfer of patients. This resulted in many patients being operated on while in coma. Associated intracranial and extracranial injury occurred in a significant number of cases. Recommendations for the management of these patients are outlined. 
nervous system diseases,"Psychological stress and the fibrositis/fibromyalgia syndrome. The relationship of stress and social support to the fibrositis/fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) was investigated by administration of 4 questionnaire instruments to 28 patients with FS, 20 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 28 pain-free normal controls. FS showed higher levels of stress as measured by daily ""hassles"" than did RA or controls. However, on a measure of major life stress, they reported lower levels. No differences were found between groups with regard to daily ""uplifts"" or social support. Correlations between those measures of stress and social support with their scores on the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale showed that the Hassles Scale was significantly related to the AIMS Psychological component. "
nervous system diseases,"Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the ampulla of vater. A case of absence of somatostatin in a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-, bombesin-, and cholecystokinin-producing tumor. A 31-year-old patient with a clinical picture of obstructive jaundice had surgical treatment, and a primary carcinoid of the ampulla of Vater (VA) was found. The tumor was studied with light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. The neoplasm had histopathologic and cytopathologic features similar to those encountered in typical neuroendocrine neoplasms. It is interesting that immunohistochemical techniques disclosed the presence of vasointestinal polypeptide, cholecystokinin, and bombesin; however, unlike most neuroendocrine neoplasms arising in VA, no somatostatin-immunoreactive cells were found. "
nervous system diseases,"Pelvic pain: lessons from anatomy and physiology. Pelvic pain is often a difficult differential diagnosis in the emergency department. For physiologic reasons, pain in the pelvis is difficult to localize to a specific organ, and pelvic peritonitis is hard to recognize. On the other hand, differences in types of pain can be very useful in arriving at a correct diagnosis. The clinician must learn to recognize superficial and deep somatic pain, and differentiate between various types of visceral pain which originate from inflammation, ischemia, or colic. A review of the anatomy and physiology of pelvic pain helps identify some of the problems as well as potential aids in approaching the patient with pelvic pain. "
nervous system diseases,A case of amnesia after excision of the septum pellucidum. Tumours of the septum pellucidum (SP) are rare and seldom associated with memory impairment either before or after operation. A patient is described who developed amnesia after transcallosal excision of a tumour of the SP. Radiology did not show any major lesion of the brain areas traditionally associated with amnesia. Because septal nuclei could have been damaged during surgery their possible role in memory functions is discussed. 
nervous system diseases,"Tracheoesophageal anastomosis for intractable aspiration pneumonia. Permanent tracheostomy and tracheoesophageal anastomosis were performed as a means of surgical intervention for the treatment of intractable aspiration pneumonia. Conventional methods of tracheoesophageal anastomosis have entailed various problems. The improved method devised by us uses the special histological features and enables safe and reliable anastomosis. By this method, the tracheal perichondrium is retained and the strength of the anastomosed portion of the trachea is maintained, the failure of sutures due to tension on the anastomotic site being prevented. Also, reanastomosis can be performed after the cure of primary disease. "
nervous system diseases,"The role of conditioning and verbal expectancy in the placebo response. Both conditioning and expectancy models have been offered in recent years as explanations for the placebo response. Following our earlier work on conditioning placebo responses in human subjects the current study examined the relative contribution made by conditioning and verbal expectancy. Group 1 received a Combined Expectancy and Conditioning Manipulation; group 2 received Expectancy Alone; group 3, Conditioning Alone; and group 4 was the control group. Subjects' responses were compared with and without a placebo cream, using iontophoretic pain stimulation. The results suggest that conditioning was more powerful than verbal expectancy in creating a placebo response. "
nervous system diseases,"Type I hypersensitivity to rubber. Seven patients with type I hypersensitivity reactions to rubber are reported. Radioallergosorbent testing with crude latex antigen was positive in 6/7 patients. Five patients had coexisting spina bifida, and all had undergone surgery before the development of rubber allergy. Rubber allergy is a new phenomenon that should be in the differential diagnosis of idiopathic anaphylaxis and urticaria. "
nervous system diseases,"Modern pharmacotherapy of migraine. Rectal ergotamine and naproxen are the major candidates for the ad hoc treatment of migraine attacks; for particularly dramatic episodes, intravenous DHE with prochlorperazine is the author's preference. For long-term stabilization, after simpler measures fail, valproate appears to be a major addition to migraine therapy. "
nervous system diseases,"Partial cytochrome b deficiency and generalized dystonia. An 18-year-old female had clinical features of idiopathic torsion dystonia with bilateral hypodense putaminal lesions on computed tomography. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy was suspected because of persistent lactic acidemia and myopathy. Studies of oxidative metabolism on isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria revealed partial cytochrome b deficiency indicating a defect in the cytochrome b- c1 complex. This finding represents a unique, multisystem syndrome of progressive dystonia, putaminal degeneration, myopathy, and mitochondrial cytochrome b deficiency. Mitochondrial metabolic disorders may be a cause of torsion dystonia when other known associated factors are absent. "
nervous system diseases,"Spontaneous neurodegeneration in transgenic mice with mutant prion protein Transgenic mice were created to assess genetic linkage between Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome and a leucine substitution at codon 102 of the human prion protein gene. Spontaneous neurologic disease with spongiform degeneration and gliosis similar to that in mouse scrapie developed at a mean age of 166 days in 35 mice expressing mouse prion protein with the leucine substitution. Thus, many of the clinical and pathological features of Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome are reproduced in transgenic mice containing a prion protein with a single amino acid substitution, illustrating that a neurodegenerative process similar to a human disease can be genetically modeled in animals. "
nervous system diseases,"Radial tunnel syndrome. An investigation of compression neuropathy as a possible cause. Conventional electromyographic and nerve-conduction studies usually do not show abnormalities in patients who have a clinical diagnosis of radial tunnel syndrome. Therefore, posterior interosseous nerve-conduction measurements were performed during forced supination in patients who had this syndrome. Only one of sixteen patients had a major increase in latency. Our data do not support the hypothesis that the signs and symptoms in most patients who have a diagnosis of radial tunnel syndrome are caused by compression of the posterior interosseous nerve. "
nervous system diseases,"The neurologic workup in patients with cervical spine disorders. Care must be exercised in interpreting the clinical and radiologic findings when assessing patients with cervical spondylosis and involvement of neural structures for surgery. If the clinical picture cannot logically be explained by the radiologic findings, further investigation is indicated to exclude a coexistent disorder. Investigations may include electrophysiologic tests, transcranial magnetic stimulation, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Only then can the indication for surgical intervention be properly determined. "
nervous system diseases,"Spinal anaesthesia in day-care surgery with a 26-gauge needle. We studied 106 day-care surgical patients (52 male) aged 18-70 yr (mean 49.6 yr) who received spinal anaesthesia with a 26-gauge spinal needle. The incidence of headache, back pain and patient acceptability were investigated after operation using a questionnaire. The incidence of postspinal headache was 7.5%, and 11.3% of patients developed back pain. One patient remained in hospital because of hypotension and dizziness. There were no major complications and patient acceptability was almost 100%. We conclude that spinal anaesthesia for day-care surgery is easy to perform and cost effective. "
nervous system diseases,"Symptomatic pineal cyst: case report. Pineal cysts are being described with increasing frequency since the advent of magnetic resonance imaging. Although pineal cysts are incidental findings in as many as 4% of magnetic resonance imaging studies, symptomatic pineal cysts are quite rare. We present a case of pineal cyst causing aqueductal obstruction with symptomatic hydrocephalus and resultant headache and syncope, which was treated by surgical resection. A review of the relevant literature and discussion follow. "
nervous system diseases,"Neurologic abnormalities in a patient with human ehrlichiosis. Human ehrlichiosis is a tick-borne rickettsial disease characterized by fever, headache, myalgias, anorexia, and occasionally rash. In our patient, changes in mental status, upper motor neuron signs, cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, and increased serum protein levels were found in association with serologically confirmed ehrlichiosis and were most likely due to vasculitis involving the central nervous system. Intraleukocytic inclusions, although observed in our case, have been infrequently found in other reported cases of ehrlichiosis. "
nervous system diseases,Autonomic dysfunction and Guillain-Barre syndrome. The use of esmolol in its management. A 17-year-old girl with Guillain-Barre syndrome and autonomic dysfunction was treated successfully with esmolol. Esmolol may be an appropriate drug for the rapid assessment and control of tachyarrhythmias in critically ill patients. 
nervous system diseases,"Brain stem tuberculoma in adult patients: diagnosis and treatment. A consecutive series of six adult patients ranging in age from 29 to 53 years is presented. The clinical and radiological features in each patient are described. Attention is drawn to the features demonstrated on computed axial tomography. In only one patient, the first encountered, was surgical excision undertaken and histological verification obtained. One patient died before any form of treatment could be instituted. The remaining four patients were treated with antituberculous chemotherapy alone and their progress monitored by sequential computed tomography. The excellent response and good outcome in this conservatively treated group are documented. "
nervous system diseases,"Herpes simplex virus type 2 meningitis without genital lesions: an immunoblot study. Two sexually active female patients presented with acute meningitis. The CSF abnormalities were severe and persistent. In spite of the absence of genital lesions, serological studies revealed a primary infection by herpes simplex virus type 2. An immunoblot study revealed intrathecal synthesis of anti-herpes antibodies early in the course of the disease. "
nervous system diseases,"Hoarseness as the sole presenting symptom of foramen magnum meningioma. Foramen magnum tumours are rare. They may present with bizarre symptoms and mimic many conditions. We report a presentation with the sole complaint of hoarseness, never previously described in the literature. Voice returned to normal after surgical removal of the foramen magnum meningioma. "
nervous system diseases,The modified Schollner costoplasty. The modified Schollner costoplasty is a cosmetic procedure for the correction of rib prominence deformity in scoliosis. We present the results of the procedure in 21 patients who had previously undergone spinal fusion for scoliosis. We found the procedure to be well tolerated without major complications. Objective cosmetic improvement was achieved in all but one case. All but one patient considered the procedure to have been of cosmetic benefit. 
nervous system diseases,"Heterotopic liver transplantation for fulminant Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease may present with severe acute hepatocellular failure. The only effective treatment for fulminant Wilson's disease is liver transplantation, which may lead to reversal of the underlying disease. Some patients with cirrhosis who are too ill to undergo orthotopic liver transplantation have been treated with heterotopic liver transplantation. However, use of heterotopic liver transplantation for fulminant hepatocellular failure has not been successful. This case study involves a patient in whom a heterotopic liver transplant was successfully used for treatment of Wilson's disease presenting with fulminant hepatocellular failure. "
nervous system diseases,"Nasal midline masses in infants and children. Dermoids, encephaloceles, and gliomas. Nasal dermoids, gliomas, and encephaloceles are uncommon congenital lesions that result from aberrant embryologic development. We have treated 46 children with these nasal lesions. In view of the potential intracranial connection, patients are at risk for intracranial infection, and early surgical correction is thus imperative. Neuroimaging studies may help to predict intracranial involvement. "
nervous system diseases,"Visual disturbance in patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. Visual disturbance in 11 patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk was analyzed. Goldmann visual field examination showed enlargement of Mariotte's blind spot in 7 of 10 patients (70%) and visual field defect or depression in 7 patients (70%). In 6 of the 7 patients with visual field defect of depression (86%), the portion of visual field damage corresponded with the location of the tumor and retinal nerve fiber bundle defect. In 1 patient, sudden loss of visual acuity occurred, presumably due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy induced by melanocytoma. "
nervous system diseases,"Mycosis fungoides-like lesions associated with phenytoin and carbamazepine therapy. We report the cases of four patients who were taking the anticonvulsant drugs phenytoin or carbamazepine and in whom skin lesions developed that showed histologic features suggestive of mycosis fungoides. Two patients had a solitary lesion on the trunk, whereas the other two patients had multiple plaques. In all four patients systemic signs were absent. "
nervous system diseases,Resolution of the adult respiratory distress syndrome following colectomy and liver transplantation. A 32-year-old woman with liver failure from end-stage cirrhosis and ulcerative colitis developed septicemia and severe ARDS. Subtotal colectomy and a successful liver transplantation resulted in complete resolution of the ARDS. 
nervous system diseases,"Aqueductal (pencil) glioma presenting as neurogenic pulmonary edema: a case report. A case of neurogenic pulmonary edema due to hydrocephalus, without initial neurological deficit, is described. Computed tomography demonstrated a ring enhancing lesion in the tectum of the mesencephalon obstructing the aqueduct of Sylvius. The lesion, on autopsy, was a rare mesencephalic glioma described in the literature as a ""pencil glioma"" of the aqueduct. "
nervous system diseases,"An unusual complication of silastic dural substitute: case report. A case is presented in which a patient developed an unusual complication after the use of Silastic dural substitute. In 1983, the patient underwent removal of a meningioma with the involved dura. Five years later, he developed around the graft material a very thick connective tissue capsule, which simulated a recurrent meningioma clinically and radiologically. "
nervous system diseases,"Complications of lateral C1-2 puncture myelography. This study reviewed the technical complication of 112 cases of lateral C1-2 puncture myelography for cervical spinal cord disorders. Spinal cord puncture and contrast injection, puncture between the occiput and C1, and blood vessel puncture were the main complications. These principally depended on the positioning of the patient's neck (hyperextension) and misdirection of the x-ray beam. For preventing major arterial puncture, the authors also reviewed 164 vertebral angiograms and determined the pathway of the vertebral arteries and the incidence of anomaly. "
nervous system diseases,"Frontal impairment and hypoperfusion in neuroacanthocytosis. Cerebral blood flow tomography, by xenon 133 inhalation or HMPAO (99mTc-d, l-hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime) technetium Tc 99m injection, revealed a severe hypoperfusion in both frontal lobes of a 40-year-old woman with confirmed neuroacanthocytosis. This finding occurred in conjunction with neuropsychological deficits consistent with selective frontal lobe dysfunction. This observation is the first documentation of this type of dementia in neuroacanthocytosis. "
nervous system diseases,Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema complicating massive diltiazem overdose. Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema has not been previously described in calcium channel blocker overdose. We describe a case of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema occurring during the course of therapy for massive diltiazem overdose in a young patient with anorexia nervosa. Review of the current literature suggests that major and minor pulmonary complications occur with some frequency in the setting of calcium channel blocker overdose although their exact incidence remains unclear. 
nervous system diseases,"The opposite pupil in herniation. I serially examined the pupil opposite the one already enlarged from transtentorial herniation in 13 patients. The main abnormalities, stereotyped in most patients, were an initially diminished light reaction with a 2.5- to 4-mm-diameter pupil, followed by slight reduction in size, and then reenlargement to greater than original size, all with preserved roundness. Subsequent deterioration varied among patients, but a transitional oval shape was infrequent and oculomotor function was preserved until both pupils were enlarged and fixed. Once the pupil on the side of a mass enlarges, heralding herniation, subsequent deterioration can be appreciated through changes in reactivity and size of the opposite pupil. "
nervous system diseases,"Poisoning with equine phenylbutazone in a racetrack worker. Phenylbutazone is a potent nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drug often used by veterinarians to treat racetrack animals. Its use in human beings is limited because of significant adverse effects and the availability of newer, safer drugs. We report the case of a 24-year-old man who ingested 17 g of equine phenylbutazone over a 24-hour period to treat the pain of a toothache. He developed grand mal seizures, coma, hypotension, respiratory and renal failure, and hepatic injury. Serum phenylbutazone concentration obtained approximately eight hours after presentation was 900 micrograms/mL. The patient recovered during six weeks of intensive supportive care and repeated hemodialysis. "
nervous system diseases,Hypothalamic or central obesity is associated with an early rise in plasma insulin concentration. Insulin levels in a 7-year-old boy with hyperphagia and obesity following an episode of meningoencephalitis were studied sequentially during the course of progressive weight gain. High fasting insulin levels (1183 pmol/L) and strikingly high insulin release in response to glucose (7892 pmol/L) were found within weeks of the onset of the illness. The abnormality in insulin secretion occurred prior to the marked weight gain. Hyperinsulinemia was not accompanied by hypoglycemia. Early hyperinsulinemia may be a primary event in the development of hyperphagia and obesity following hypothalamic injury. 
nervous system diseases,"Familial eating epilepsy. Eating-related seizures affecting 20 individuals among 59 siblings belonging to nine families are presented. The type of epilepsy was partial in all the affected individuals, and the seizures complex in 15 and simple in 5, secondarily generalized in the majority. The onset of epilepsy, in most cases, was in the second decade of life. A remarkable degree of intra-family consistency was observed with regard to age at onset, symptomatology of seizures and timing of eating seizures. The study demonstrates sibling clustering in a partial epilepsy, implicating for the first time genetic susceptibility in the aetiology of eating epilepsy. "
nervous system diseases,"Role of serum prolactin determination in evaluation of impotent patient. Hyperprolactinemia is a recognized cause of impotence. The discovery of elevated prolactin levels in impotent men is very important since pharmacotherapy in this instance is highly successful. We review our experience with prolactin determinations in impotent men, and a population is defined that may benefit from routine prolactin determination. In our experience, the predominant symptom associated with hyperprolactinemia in men is loss of libido. "
nervous system diseases,Postencephalitic acquired Tourette-like syndrome in a child. We report a 6-year-old girl who developed a Tourette-like syndrome following presumed herpes encephalitis. This case suggests that tics can be acquired in childhood and may be associated with lesions involving basal ganglia or limbic circuitry. 
nervous system diseases,"Relaxation training in school classes does not reduce headache complaints. The effect of teacher-presented Progressive Relaxation Training (PRT) on headaches, fear of failure and school problems was studied in school students. During ten physical education lessons, students received either PRT (n = 110) or placebo training (n = 92). The effect of the training was investigated in students who indicated the presence of headaches in a pre-training diary. No significant differences were found between both training groups regarding headache frequency, duration and intensity and the psychological variables. On the basis of these and previous findings, it is recommended to present PRT to fairly small groups of self-selected subjects instead of complete classes. "
nervous system diseases,"Lip paresthesia associated with a jaw mass. A case is reported in which mandibular swelling and lower lip numbness were the first signs of a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung. The development of paresthesia, with or without other oral symptoms, requires that a diagnosis of malignancy be considered until confirmed or ruled out by tissue biopsy. A thorough head and neck examination in all patients, especially in those whose history or habits may indicate increased risk of malignancy is necessary. "
nervous system diseases,"Sudden cervical pain: spontaneous cervical epidural hematoma. Three cases of cervical epidural hematoma are reported. Acute neck pain usually associated with a mild effort, closely followed by radicular pain and a neurologic deficit below the lesion is the typical presentation of this extremely rare and difficult diagnosis. As prognosis depends on preoperative neurologic state, the authors emphasize the importance of prompt identification of this lesion. The diagnosis is confirmed by computed tomography, and emergency neurosurgical laminectomy is mandatory. "
nervous system diseases,"A study of the seasonal variation of migraine. Available evidence supports the contention that migraine involves a disturbance in serotonin function. Several parameters of serotonin function in humans have been found to vary seasonally and may underlie the seasonal fluctuations observed in many clinical neuropsychiatric phenomena that are thought to involve serotonin dysfunction. We therefore postulated that migraine headaches might also vary seasonally and examined the admissions to our hospital over a 20-year period with a primary diagnosis of migraine. Peak admissions were found to occur most frequently in the spring for females in comparison to males (p less than or equal to 0.04, chi-square). The implications of these findings are discussed. "
nervous system diseases,"Help for the hurting elderly. Safe use of drugs to relieve pain. Pharmacologic management of pain in elderly patients is a common and difficult clinical problem. Because of altered drug metabolism and pharmacodynamics in the elderly, the drugs of choice are different than in younger patients and side effects occur more often. However, with judicious use and monitoring for toxicity, oral medications given as part of a multimodality approach can achieve adequate analgesia in most elderly patients. "
nervous system diseases,"Cognitive deficits in children: adaptive behavior and treatment techniques. Impaired cognitive functioning impedes the development of age-appropriate adaptive behavior, thus adding to the burdens of many children with epilepsy. Detailed neuropsychological assessment can identify the underlying ability-related impairments that contribute to the adaptive behavior deficiencies evidenced, particularly in the home and school settings. This information can serve as the basis for a multidisciplinary treatment plan tailored to individual needs. Ideally, the need for such a treatment plan should be perceived early in childhood, so that it can be developed and applied preventively. The same remedial principles also apply in older children and are here set out in detail. "
nervous system diseases,Fasciculations due to verapamil in a patient with neuropathy. A patient with pre-existing peripheral neuropathy developed generalized fasciculations under verapamil which ceased after discontinuation of the drug. It is suggested that the increase in acetylcholine (ACh) release at the neuromuscular junction by verapamil may trigger fasciculation in the state of regeneration at ACh-sensitive sites of axon terminals and immature axon sprouts. 
nervous system diseases,"Extradural implantation of sacral anterior root stimulators. A technique for extradural deafferentation of the S2 to S5 segments and extradural implantation of stimulating electrodes is described, and its application to twelve patients with spinal cord lesions is reported. Nine patients use their implants for micturition, and seven are fully continent. The advantages and disadvantages of this technique compared with the more usual intrathecal procedure are discussed. "
nervous system diseases,Reflex sympathetic dystrophy after clavicle fracture: case report. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) of the anterior chest wall is a rare entity. A MEDLINE search in all languages of the world's literature from 1966 to the present yielded no report of the association of clavicle fracture with this pain syndrome. Two cases are presented and the anatomic variations of the supraclavicular nerves in relation to the clavicle are discussed. 
nervous system diseases,"Protective and curative effects of rifampicin in Acanthamoeba meningitis of the mouse. BALB/c mice inoculated nasally with Acanthamoeba culbertsoni, resulting in amebic encephalitis and death 3-7 days, were treated with rifampicin prophylactically (daily for 2 days with 75 and 100 mg/kg) and after infection (daily for 5 days with doses of 10-100 mg/kg). Prophylactic treatment resulted in full protection against infection, as assessed by absence of symptoms of central nervous system malfunction and negative brain culture 10 days after inoculation. Curative treatment was effective at the same doses; however, at doses of 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg, only two of six animals were free of symptoms and infection. "
nervous system diseases,"Diurnal differences in response to oral levodopa. Diurnal differences in duration and quality of motor response to levodopa are frequently described by patients. The quality and duration of motor responses were objectively assessed to morning and afternoon oral levodopa doses in five patients with Parkinsonian motor fluctuations who complained of diurnal variation in response to their normal levodopa medication. Results suggest that under controlled conditions which eliminated the effects of diet and overlapping levodopa effects the response to levodopa remained unchanged throughout the day, and that the duration of response could be predicted by plasma levodopa levels. "
nervous system diseases,Carbamazepine-induced antinuclear antibodies and systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome. A 20-year-old woman developed a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like syndrome and a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) soon after initiation of carbamazepine (CBZ) therapy. Symptoms and serology became normal after CBZ was discontinued. CBZ-induced SLE is an important but underecognized phenomenon. 
nervous system diseases,"Strokes in African-Americans. Hypertension is the most important risk factor for stroke, especially in African-Americans. Improved control of high blood pressure nationwide is a key factor in the recent dramatic decline in stroke frequency, most notably in African-American women. Hypertension control programs must be adequately funded and expanded. African-Americans have a disproportionately high incidence of risk factors for stroke, including hypertension. There is evidence that the cerebral vessels involved in ischemic stroke in African-Americans may differ from those of Caucasians. There is an urgent need for more research on stroke in general, risk factor relations in particular, and mechanisms in the pathogenesis of stroke in African-Americans. "
nervous system diseases,"Flecked retina associated with ring 17 chromosome. We report the case of a mentally retarded male with a ring 17 chromosome who had subretinal drusen-like deposits in each eye. This is the second report of flecked retina in a patient with ring 17 chromosome, suggesting that there may be a causal relationship between abnormalities of chromosome 17 and retinal pigment epithelial or photoreceptor dysfunction. "
nervous system diseases,"The classification and diagnosis of headache disorders. Headache disorders recently have been reclassified, and new operational diagnostic criteria assist in making the correct diagnosis. These diagnostic criteria have been accepted worldwide. "
nervous system diseases,"Cervicogenic headache: diagnostic criteria. Criteria for the diagnosis of cervicogenic headache are proposed, which include unilateral head pain, symptoms and signs of neck involvement, non-clustering episodic moderate pain originating in the neck then spreading to the head, and response to root or nerve blockade; plus rarer and non-obligatory features such as autonomic disturbances, dizziness, phonophotophobia, monocular visual blurring, and difficulty swallowing. "
nervous system diseases,"Radiation-induced cranial nerve palsy: hypoglossal nerve and vocal cord palsies. Cranial nerve palsies are an unexpected complication of radiotherapy for head and neck tumours. We present a case of this radiation-induced cranial palsy. An 18-year-old female with nasopharyngeal carcinoma developed a right hypoglossal nerve palsy 42 months after cancericidal doses of radiotherapy. In addition, she developed a bilateral vocal cord palsy 62 months after therapy. Follow-up over four years has demonstrated no evidence of tumour recurrence and no sign of neurological improvement. "
nervous system diseases,"Familial trigeminal anesthesia. Familial congenital trigeminal anesthesia as an isolated abnormality is an unusual disorder. To our knowledge, only one family has previously been reported. We report here a family with three affected members demonstrating facial anesthesia, bilateral corneal changes, and nasal septal damage secondary to self-traumatization. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated hypoplasia of gasserian ganglia and trigeminal nerves in the affected father of two affected sons. The pathogenesis of this disorder appears to be congenital hypoplasia of the trigeminal nerves and gasserian ganglia that is inherited in a dominant fashion. "
nervous system diseases,Coccydynia. Aetiology and treatment. A five-year prospective trial involving 120 patients was undertaken to investigate the aetiology and treatment of coccydynia. The cause lies in some localised musculoskeletal abnormality in the coccygeal region. Lumbosacral disc prolapse is not a significant factor. The condition is genuine and distressing and we found no evidence of neurosis in our patients. Physiotherapy was of little help in treatment but 60% of patients responded to local injections of corticosteroid and local anaesthesia. Manipulation and injection was even more successful and cured about 85%. Coccygectomy was required in almost 20% and had a success rate of over 90%. 
nervous system diseases,"Non-drug related asystole associated with anaesthetic induction. A patient is presented where routine venepuncture associated with anaesthetic induction resulted in bradycardia and asystole. The case highlights the need for special caution with, and ECG monitoring throughout induction for, patients with a history of syncope. It also demonstrates the need for caution when attributing cardiovascular events during induction to the effect of the induction agents used. "
nervous system diseases,"Botulinum toxin therapy. Botulinum toxin therapy has emerged as a treatment modality for a variety of spastic- or contracture-related muscle diseases. Its safety has been proven for long-term use in the treatment of benign essential blepharospasm, hemifacial spasm, and certain types of strabismus. Recent approval from the Federal Drug Administration should make botulinum toxin available for use in a greater number of patients. "
